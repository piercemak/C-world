WEBVTT

00:18.690 --> 00:20.734
Powertron!

00:20.818 --> 00:23.320
Special Attack!

00:27.324 --> 00:32.162
Curses!
I'll get you next time, Powertron!

00:33.622 --> 00:34.998
Hold it, Kingburg!

00:35.040 --> 00:37.209
Dammit! Did he get away?

00:37.292 --> 00:42.130
However, we Powertrons will uphold
the peace of the network!

00:42.214 --> 00:44.299
Yeah!

00:52.349 --> 00:53.827
That was nothing like the stuff on TV.

00:53.851 --> 00:55.811
That was so cheap!

00:58.397 --> 01:01.233
Man, that's like way too expensive.

01:01.316 --> 01:04.736
Like I said,
it's from that show in Hiroshima.

01:04.778 --> 01:06.154
The one I couldn't go to?

01:06.238 --> 01:10.534
When Rei went fumbling her song
'coz those guys started trouble...

01:10.576 --> 01:14.872
And this is the MiniDisc from when
Mima sang in Rei's place.

01:14.913 --> 01:17.040
It's a precious sample of
Mimarin's singing voice!

01:17.082 --> 01:19.835
Oh, yeah... Is that rumor true?

01:19.918 --> 01:21.295
Oh, that?

01:21.378 --> 01:24.047
Three left, only three left...

01:24.923 --> 01:29.052
Last issue of CHAMMINGBIRD...
only three left.

01:29.970 --> 01:32.014
400 yen... 400 yen...

01:32.097 --> 01:33.390
Yeah, I read about that too.

01:33.473 --> 01:36.310
I heard she's announcing it today
coz it's the last concert here.

01:36.393 --> 01:41.148
At a nothing show like this?
That's pretty cold of Mimarin!

01:41.231 --> 01:44.234
There's been lots of solo
activity going on lately...

01:44.318 --> 01:47.279
And only Mimarin's like
worthy of being an actress?

01:47.362 --> 01:49.406
Look, they're back.

01:49.448 --> 01:51.783
The guys that caused trouble last week.

01:51.867 --> 01:56.163
I just hope they don't make
a mess today, of all days.

01:58.290 --> 02:00.542
I'm getting nervous!

02:00.626 --> 02:02.419
Come on, sit still!

02:02.461 --> 02:04.963
Hey, what's up with this!?
This is all frayed!

02:05.047 --> 02:06.089
Don't look at me!

02:06.173 --> 02:08.967
- Get me some masking tape!
- Hello? Yes.

02:09.051 --> 02:11.637
Remember your entrance
in the second song, Mima!

02:11.720 --> 02:13.430
Don't pressure me!

02:13.513 --> 02:14.598
I need a drink!

02:14.681 --> 02:17.481
- I'm sorry. I'll call you back.
- You can have drinks after the event.

02:17.559 --> 02:19.102
You're on!

02:22.814 --> 02:25.108
<i>And it looks like they're set.</i>

02:27.778 --> 02:32.449
<i>Without further adieu, please welcome
to our stage... CHAM!!</i>

03:04.314 --> 03:10.070
<i>Got a question about your love?</i>

03:10.153 --> 03:15.951
<i>Send a cry for help and wait a bit.</i>

03:16.034 --> 03:19.830
<i>Love makes your heart race.</i>

03:19.871 --> 03:23.041
<i>If it means you're loved in the end...</i>

03:23.125 --> 03:26.336
<i>be much more aggressive...</i>

03:26.378 --> 03:29.715
<i>because you will get a chance.</i>

03:29.798 --> 03:37.798
<i>The angel of love smiles at you.</i>

04:06.209 --> 04:10.881
Mima! Mima! Mima!

04:19.431 --> 04:22.476
<i>Mima should be acting, not singing!</i>

04:26.897 --> 04:28.732
<i>I can't do this after all!</i>

04:28.774 --> 04:30.525
<i>Mika...</i>

04:30.609 --> 04:33.361
They want her in a drama series.

04:33.445 --> 04:35.280
There are no better deals than this!

04:35.363 --> 04:38.116
She can act AND sing!
That should be all right!

04:38.200 --> 04:41.453
Her schedule with the other two
is already starting to mismatch!

04:41.536 --> 04:45.290
She didn't go through those hard
lessons to become an actress!

04:45.373 --> 04:48.919
The TV producer praised Mima's acting!

04:48.960 --> 04:52.380
But what about MIMA'S feelings!?

04:53.465 --> 04:54.549
<i>And wait a bit.</i>

04:54.591 --> 04:58.386
<i>Love makes your heart race.</i>

04:58.470 --> 05:01.598
<i>If it means you're loved in the end...</i>

05:01.640 --> 05:04.851
<i>be much more aggressive...</i>

05:04.935 --> 05:08.396
<i>because you will get a chance.</i>

05:08.480 --> 05:16.279
<i>The angel of love smiles at you.</i>

05:28.708 --> 05:31.044
Thank you very much.

05:31.128 --> 05:35.173
It was a fun concert, but we
only have one song left...

05:35.257 --> 05:37.592
We just got here!

05:38.969 --> 05:45.600
Umm... Before our last song,
we have news to tell you...

05:46.309 --> 05:50.981
Um, I, Mima Kirigoe, had a fun
time as a member of CHAM...

05:51.022 --> 05:53.525
Out of the way!

05:53.567 --> 05:56.528
What did we do!? HUH!?

06:02.784 --> 06:04.995
Quit showin' off!
You're only a part-timer!

06:05.078 --> 06:06.246
Outta my face, ya asshole!

06:06.329 --> 06:07.664
YOU get out of here!

06:07.747 --> 06:10.792
What the hell!? Who are you
telling to leave, you fucker!?

06:10.876 --> 06:12.711
It wasn't me!

06:13.753 --> 06:16.590
What are you doing!? Get the hell
over here, whoever threw that!

06:16.673 --> 06:18.550
Go home! Go home!

06:18.633 --> 06:22.012
- Dammit!
- Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home!

06:22.554 --> 06:24.431
Them again!

06:24.514 --> 06:25.724
We're canceling the show!

06:25.807 --> 06:27.017
But today is!

06:29.186 --> 06:31.980
Shut up! Goddammit!

06:32.063 --> 06:35.984
Go home! Go home! Go home! Go home!

06:36.067 --> 06:37.569
Stop it!

06:44.117 --> 06:45.952
Today...

06:46.036 --> 06:49.039
Just today... I wanted to have
a good time with all of you!

06:50.540 --> 06:54.294
What attitude from some no-namer!

06:55.587 --> 06:57.297
You little!?

07:01.092 --> 07:03.386
What do you want, you freak?

07:03.428 --> 07:05.805
Let's go!

07:18.652 --> 07:25.533
A-Actually... as of today, I...

07:26.660 --> 07:29.412
As of today,
Mima will graduate from CHAM!

07:29.454 --> 07:32.916
- What!?
- Why?

07:35.502 --> 07:37.420
Thank you all.

07:37.504 --> 07:43.343
I'm really happy that I spent the last
2 1/2 years with you all as part of CHAM!

07:43.802 --> 07:50.350
I hope you'll support me as
I do my best as a rookie actress.

07:52.143 --> 07:55.981
So this will be my last song.
Please listen.

08:07.158 --> 08:09.661
Well, it totally makes sense from
the agency's point of view.

08:09.744 --> 08:12.080
Pop idols just don't make money... right?

08:12.163 --> 08:14.082
Metamorphosis, huh?

08:14.165 --> 08:18.253
<i>I still remember well...</i>

08:18.336 --> 08:22.465
<i>that warmth you'd given me.</i>

08:22.549 --> 08:29.389
<i>It was in the gentle rays of sunlight.</i>

08:31.099 --> 08:35.270
<i>I had believed that...</i>

08:35.353 --> 08:39.441
<i>the days past when...</i>

08:39.524 --> 08:47.490
<i>we were in love, were everything.</i>

08:47.574 --> 08:51.911
<i>Now, embraced by the memories...</i>

08:51.995 --> 08:56.041
<i>I have become a coward.</i>

08:56.124 --> 09:00.295
<i>I am choosing to live a life that...</i>

09:00.378 --> 09:02.047
<i>I can't feel any...</i>

09:02.547 --> 09:06.468
- Mimarin!
- Don't leave us! Don't quit!

09:12.724 --> 09:14.642
Mimarin! Mimarin!

09:14.726 --> 09:16.686
Thank you.

09:16.728 --> 09:20.148
I'm always looking at Mima's Room!

09:41.211 --> 09:45.298
Geez! This cheese already went bad!

09:58.812 --> 10:02.816
I'm sorry...
I forgot to feed you yesterday.

10:16.037 --> 10:18.957
<i>The earthquake that happened
in Mie prefecture...</i>

10:19.040 --> 10:22.001
<i>flattened towns throughout the region.</i>

10:22.085 --> 10:28.007
<i>The government reports 200 dead, but
the total number of victims are...</i>

10:28.091 --> 10:34.055
<i>yet to be determined since many
more are missing amid the rubble.</i>

10:34.139 --> 10:37.183
<i>Authorities have called in troops
for rescue operations...</i>

10:37.267 --> 10:40.353
<i>however, because the area
is already getting dark...</i>

10:40.437 --> 10:43.356
Thanks for all the work over the years.

10:44.732 --> 10:47.902
Bye bye, Mima the pop idol.

10:55.493 --> 10:58.538
"Sing for us forever"...

10:58.705 --> 11:01.374
I really can't do that.

11:08.214 --> 11:14.804
"I always like looking into Mima's Room.
I've put up a link to Mima's Room."

11:14.846 --> 11:16.389
What is this?

11:30.695 --> 11:33.323
- Hello?
<i>- Mima! You're home!</i>

11:33.364 --> 11:34.908
Mom!

11:36.034 --> 11:39.204
Yeah, I'm fine! How are you?

11:40.455 --> 11:43.374
Really?

11:43.458 --> 11:47.462
Yeah. Today was the last one.
No more singing for me.

11:47.545 --> 11:50.465
<i>I remember when you kept saying
you wanted to be a singer.</i>

11:50.548 --> 11:53.593
This is my big chance!
I told you that already!

11:53.676 --> 11:57.055
<i>Lately, we've all been looking
forward to each new single!</i>

11:57.138 --> 12:01.643
<i>Your uncle over in Yamaguchi
buys 20 copies every time!</i>

12:01.726 --> 12:04.979
You just don't understand
this industry, Mom.

12:05.021 --> 12:07.607
<i>Wasn't singing what you were best at?</i>

12:07.690 --> 12:10.443
The pop idol image is suffocating me!

12:10.527 --> 12:13.238
Besides, nowadays pop idols are...

12:13.321 --> 12:17.367
Wait, I've got a call on the other line...

12:17.450 --> 12:19.911
Yes, Kirigoe here...

12:19.994 --> 12:20.994
Hello?

12:23.081 --> 12:25.291
Hello?

12:28.378 --> 12:32.423
Mom? Just a wrong number.

12:33.216 --> 12:35.468
Yeah, I know.

12:35.552 --> 12:37.845
Oh, wait! The bath!

12:38.388 --> 12:39.548
Call me back in five minutes.

12:46.104 --> 12:47.480
Oh, Mother!

12:50.024 --> 12:52.986
A fax? Who's it from?

12:58.533 --> 13:03.496
<i>Traitor traitor traltor
TRAiTor TrAltoR TralTor</i>

13:18.136 --> 13:20.513
Who are you?

13:21.347 --> 13:23.433
"Who are you?"

13:23.516 --> 13:25.893
"Who are you?"

13:41.826 --> 13:45.496
Do you know what that note means, Rumi?

13:51.336 --> 13:54.047
It's an Internet home page.

13:54.714 --> 13:57.091
Oh, that thing that's been popular lately!

13:57.175 --> 13:59.844
And what is it?

13:59.927 --> 14:02.096
How can I describe it?

14:02.180 --> 14:04.599
It's kind of like computer networks.

14:04.641 --> 14:05.767
And?

14:05.850 --> 14:08.936
Considering that this person
"put up a link to Mima's Room"...

14:09.020 --> 14:13.191
this "Mima's Room" thing
is the title of a web site.

14:13.274 --> 14:14.525
You don't get it, do you?

14:14.609 --> 14:15.985
Nope. Not one bit.

14:16.027 --> 14:17.320
All right!

14:17.403 --> 14:19.030
Sorry to keep you waiting.

14:19.113 --> 14:21.949
We're ready for the take!

14:27.622 --> 14:30.166
Don't make me laugh!

14:30.249 --> 14:32.710
You're laughing on your own!

14:32.752 --> 14:34.045
5 seconds!

14:34.128 --> 14:36.547
4, 3, 2...

14:39.008 --> 14:41.594
The younger sister of Rika,
the murder victim, is here.

14:41.678 --> 14:42.845
Would you like to see her?

14:42.929 --> 14:44.430
Mr. Yamashiro.

14:47.141 --> 14:52.271
Do you know why the culprit peels
off the skin of his victims?

14:52.355 --> 14:56.818
I assume he gets sexual stimulation
from such activities...

14:57.402 --> 15:00.738
- He wants to become one.
- Become... what?

15:00.822 --> 15:04.033
A woman... or...

15:04.951 --> 15:07.120
CUT!

15:07.954 --> 15:11.457
Eri Ochiai is a great actress after all!

15:11.541 --> 15:15.002
She's a completely different person
when the camera is rolling!

15:15.086 --> 15:16.337
That's good!

15:16.421 --> 15:19.132
NEXT! Scene 32!

15:20.133 --> 15:22.385
Rika's sister, you're on!

15:22.427 --> 15:24.137
Here!

15:25.179 --> 15:26.431
Hold this!

15:26.472 --> 15:27.098
Nervous?

15:27.181 --> 15:29.392
A bit.

15:33.771 --> 15:36.774
Not much to get nervous about
when you have only one line...

15:38.985 --> 15:41.571
How's our star actress?

15:41.612 --> 15:44.532
Mr. Tadokoro. She's just going on now.

15:48.411 --> 15:50.079
"Who are you?"

15:50.163 --> 15:51.748
"Who are you?"

15:51.831 --> 15:52.831
"Who..."

15:57.378 --> 16:00.506
That's what I mean!

16:23.821 --> 16:24.864
Good morning!

16:24.947 --> 16:26.282
Morning!

16:26.365 --> 16:27.617
Good morning.

16:28.701 --> 16:30.995
Hello, everyone.

16:31.078 --> 16:32.538
Good morning.

16:32.622 --> 16:34.332
Mr. Shibuya! You're here too?

16:34.415 --> 16:36.918
Hi, Eri. How's it going?

16:36.959 --> 16:41.547
Sir, your lines are too hard!
I don't want to do it anymore!

16:41.631 --> 16:43.800
Don't say that!

16:43.841 --> 16:48.429
But the story is really good!!
I love stuff like this!

16:48.471 --> 16:49.931
You're good at egging people on!

16:50.014 --> 16:54.811
Eri. There were this many fan
letters sent to the station!

16:54.894 --> 16:56.854
Thank you, Mr. Tejima.

16:56.896 --> 16:58.648
Kuro...

16:59.899 --> 17:01.651
Oh, this one's not for you.

17:02.610 --> 17:05.279
Well, keep up the good work.

17:05.321 --> 17:08.157
So, Sir, tell me!

17:08.199 --> 17:10.159
Who's the criminal?

17:10.243 --> 17:12.954
Sorry, can't tell you.
That'd spoil the fun.

17:15.289 --> 17:17.708
So what ARE you going to
do about the criminal?

17:17.792 --> 17:21.712
You're gonna have to
make your mind up soon.

17:23.130 --> 17:26.884
Good morning, Mr. Tejima! Mr. Shibuya!

17:26.968 --> 17:28.344
Oh, hello there...

17:29.470 --> 17:32.682
Mima's getting good reviews.
Even among station staff.

17:32.723 --> 17:37.311
If that's the case, don't you think
she's got too few lines?

17:37.979 --> 17:40.273
So he says, Shibuya.

17:40.356 --> 17:42.316
Hey, don't look at me!

17:42.400 --> 17:47.321
Sir! Please! Make use of
Mima just a little bit more!

17:48.239 --> 17:51.200
But see... She's a pop idol, right?

17:51.242 --> 17:52.618
They're really hard to use...

17:52.702 --> 17:56.080
That's no problem!
She's done with being a pop idol!

17:56.163 --> 17:57.373
Really?

17:57.415 --> 18:00.918
We want to give her a
drastic image change, too.

18:01.002 --> 18:03.129
We're ready for the take!

18:04.505 --> 18:07.216
Oh, this is for Mima.

18:10.428 --> 18:12.221
"Who are you?"

18:12.305 --> 18:13.556
"Who are you?"

18:13.639 --> 18:15.266
5 seconds!

18:15.349 --> 18:18.394
4, 3, 2...

18:25.109 --> 18:26.319
Mr. Tadokoro!?

18:27.403 --> 18:29.322
Mr. Tadokoro!

18:30.489 --> 18:33.075
Mr. Tadokoro!!

18:37.288 --> 18:38.331
I'm all right...

18:39.248 --> 18:41.208
What the hell is this!?

18:41.250 --> 18:43.628
I think that letter just exploded!?

18:43.711 --> 18:45.630
Call an ambulance! An ambulance!

18:45.671 --> 18:47.298
Yes!

18:47.381 --> 18:51.344
<i>Is a warning.
The next one will be REAL.</i>

19:16.535 --> 19:18.955
We're all set now.

19:18.996 --> 19:21.374
Rumi, you're really amazing!

19:21.457 --> 19:25.252
I'll sign you up for online services now.

19:25.544 --> 19:27.296
Okay.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.799
What do you think, Rumi?

19:29.840 --> 19:31.008
About what?

19:31.092 --> 19:33.135
About that thing the other day.

19:34.095 --> 19:36.555
Oh, that...

19:36.639 --> 19:39.016
Credit card number...

19:39.058 --> 19:42.812
Shouldn't we have called the police?

19:42.853 --> 19:46.649
Mr. Tadokoro said not to.
We can't do anything about it.

19:47.775 --> 19:50.486
But it was a crime!

19:50.528 --> 19:53.656
And it might have been me!

19:54.281 --> 19:57.493
It's okay. It was just a prank.

19:57.576 --> 19:59.996
Fortunately,
Mr. Tadokoro wasn't badly hurt.

20:00.037 --> 20:03.374
So you shouldn't worry, Mima.

20:03.457 --> 20:06.669
Anyway, Mima, I'll explain all
of this so listen carefully.

20:06.711 --> 20:08.004
Okay!

20:08.045 --> 20:11.674
This is a browser for the World Wide Web.

20:11.757 --> 20:13.968
You launch it by double-clicking here.

20:14.010 --> 20:16.095
Wha? Double-clip?

20:16.178 --> 20:17.763
What are you going to do with a clip?

20:17.847 --> 20:19.181
But...

20:19.265 --> 20:23.310
See, next to "location" you enter the URL.

20:23.394 --> 20:25.229
It's not hard, is it?

20:25.312 --> 20:27.189
Come on, Rumi!

20:27.231 --> 20:30.026
Can't you explain it to me in Japanese?

20:30.067 --> 20:33.571
Boy! Why did you buy a computer when
you don't know anything about it?

20:33.654 --> 20:36.490
Because they said it was easy!

20:36.574 --> 20:39.493
Oh, all right. I'll explain it from
the beginning once more...

20:39.577 --> 20:41.537
Okay!

20:48.919 --> 20:52.548
H... T... T... P...

20:57.011 --> 20:58.554
Ooh, something came up!

20:59.597 --> 21:02.058
Hey, I'm doing pretty well!

21:02.099 --> 21:04.727
And now...

21:04.810 --> 21:06.520
There it is!

21:06.562 --> 21:08.564
<i>Mima's Room</i>

21:11.609 --> 21:12.901
<i>Mima's Room</i>

21:12.902 --> 21:13.902
<i>Mima's Diary</i>

21:13.903 --> 21:15.071
<i>Mima's Diary</i> What's this?

21:15.112 --> 21:16.489
"It was just terrible!"

21:16.572 --> 21:19.116
"I screwed up the choreography,
AND forgot my lyrics."

21:19.200 --> 21:21.786
"I feel so sorry to all my fans!"

21:21.869 --> 21:24.789
"This morning, when I got off
the train left foot first..."

21:24.872 --> 21:27.041
"was when all the bad stuff started."

21:27.124 --> 21:29.710
"I always make it a point
that my right foot..."

21:29.752 --> 21:31.921
"goes first into the
train and into the bath."

21:32.004 --> 21:35.216
Someone sure knows me! What's this?

21:35.299 --> 21:38.427
"Today was my 21st birthday."

21:38.511 --> 21:44.767
"Yukiko, Rei, and the staff at the agency
held a party for me. It was terrific!"

21:44.850 --> 21:48.562
"Coming home, I went grocery
shopping at the usual store."

21:48.604 --> 21:50.564
"I got mineral water and milk."

21:50.648 --> 21:53.359
"The milk just has to be Cow Brand milk."

21:53.442 --> 21:56.028
"I have to allow myself at
least this much luxury."

21:56.112 --> 22:00.282
"And food for my precious
fish, of course..."

22:00.366 --> 22:06.372
"May 12th. I was impressed with Eri
Ochiai's performance in Double Bind."

22:06.455 --> 22:09.250
"She's another person when
the camera is rolling..."

22:09.291 --> 22:10.543
What is all this?

22:10.626 --> 22:12.711
How do they know this much?

22:12.795 --> 22:15.297
<i>Who are you?</i>

22:15.381 --> 22:18.008
<i>Who are you?</i>

22:18.092 --> 22:20.886
<i>Who are you?</i>

22:20.970 --> 22:23.430
<i>Who are you?</i>

22:23.514 --> 22:28.853
<i>Who are you?</i>

22:30.896 --> 22:33.315
Who are you?

22:33.357 --> 22:36.902
I'm Dr. Toko Asamiya,
specializing in psychiatry.

22:36.986 --> 22:40.823
I was your late sister's psychiatrist.

22:40.906 --> 22:43.033
There are some things
I'd like to ask you.

22:43.117 --> 22:45.119
Detective Yamashiro! Another one!

22:45.161 --> 22:46.287
What!?

23:06.682 --> 23:09.768
<i>This is the fifth victim...</i>

23:12.688 --> 23:14.231
Just three shots.

23:16.525 --> 23:20.321
Is this work really worth leaving CHAM for?

23:20.362 --> 23:23.240
Rumi. Do you know how hard
it is to get a character...

23:23.282 --> 23:26.202
that reappears in a drama series?
Even a role like this?

23:26.243 --> 23:29.246
Yes, I do. But...

23:31.665 --> 23:36.879
This is where Mima proves if she can
be seen as a real actress or not.

23:36.962 --> 23:40.549
But we should sell Mima as a pop idol!

23:40.633 --> 23:45.512
Really. Times are different from when
Rumi Hidaka was a working pop idol.

23:45.554 --> 23:46.972
I know that.

23:47.056 --> 23:50.142
Nowadays, there are no places for
pop idols to appeal to the masses.

23:50.226 --> 23:53.646
This is the branch point that will
decide if Mima lasts or not.

23:53.729 --> 23:56.023
Well, excuse me for not surviving.

23:56.065 --> 23:57.816
Please, Rumi!

23:57.900 --> 24:02.529
There's nothing better than having Mima
be able to change into an actress!

24:02.613 --> 24:05.574
She came to Tokyo to sing...

24:05.616 --> 24:07.618
Think!

24:07.660 --> 24:11.580
On record sales we make
practically nothing!

24:13.958 --> 24:17.336
But I do wish that they'd
use her a little bit more...

24:17.419 --> 24:20.047
Sorry we're not that profitable!

24:20.589 --> 24:22.549
Good morning!

24:22.633 --> 24:25.719
How's the new CHAM going?

24:32.601 --> 24:35.938
<i>Double Bind</i>

24:46.282 --> 24:48.200
It's the pits!

24:48.284 --> 24:50.911
Double Bind... yeah, I saw it too.

24:50.953 --> 24:52.621
It was so boring!

24:52.705 --> 24:57.167
Why do all psycho-thrillers made
in Japan turn out that way?

24:57.251 --> 24:59.503
Mimarin's not in it!

24:59.586 --> 25:02.506
Oh yeah. How many scenes was
she in last week? Four?

25:02.589 --> 25:04.800
Three.

25:04.883 --> 25:08.262
Somebody save Mimarin! PLEASE!

25:09.305 --> 25:15.311
<i>A HOME PAGE ON THE INTERNET:
You can make one too!</i>

25:30.868 --> 25:33.149
This morning, when I got off
the train left foot first...

26:16.413 --> 26:18.082
Hey, It's Mimarin!

26:18.165 --> 26:18.874
Good morning!

26:18.957 --> 26:20.501
Good morning, Mimarin!

26:20.542 --> 26:21.811
Break a leg with that drama series!

26:21.835 --> 26:23.796
Hey, wait, Mimarin...

26:25.214 --> 26:29.510
Do they get all unfriendly when
they become actresses?

26:38.018 --> 26:40.437
<i>Hit-And-Run at Shinkaido.</i>

26:40.521 --> 26:43.982
<i>Tadashi Doi (18), in critical condition.</i>

26:56.578 --> 26:58.414
Good morning!

26:58.497 --> 26:59.706
Good morning, Mima.

26:59.790 --> 27:01.667
Cheers!

27:01.750 --> 27:04.002
Cheers!

27:06.338 --> 27:08.549
What's going on?

27:08.590 --> 27:10.634
CHAM's new single...

27:11.385 --> 27:15.139
Oh, wow! They got 83rd?

27:15.222 --> 27:18.100
We never even made the charts before.

27:18.183 --> 27:19.183
One, two...

27:22.646 --> 27:24.565
Congratulations!

27:25.858 --> 27:27.234
We did it!

27:27.317 --> 27:29.278
Now we've got to work together really hard!

27:29.361 --> 27:32.197
But will there be anyone in the audience?

27:32.281 --> 27:34.783
Sure there will be, Mima!

27:36.743 --> 27:40.080
Your next script.
It has a few more lines.

27:40.122 --> 27:41.457
Yeah.

27:41.999 --> 27:44.001
You've both done great!

27:44.084 --> 27:47.504
CHAM is totally okay being a duo!

28:04.480 --> 28:07.191
Hey, you. Are you currently
in any talent agency?

28:07.274 --> 28:09.359
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.154
Hey!

28:12.237 --> 28:14.948
Wouldn't you be interested
in being a model?

28:14.990 --> 28:17.242
Model?

28:17.910 --> 28:19.411
Cut!

28:25.834 --> 28:29.630
OK! We're going to move for the next scene!

28:32.549 --> 28:34.510
Who's that girl?

28:34.551 --> 28:37.095
I don't know.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.098
Hey, hey, hey!

28:40.182 --> 28:44.311
I saw next week's script, Shibuya.
You're wonderful!

28:44.394 --> 28:47.606
<i>I didn't think it would come to this!</i>

28:47.689 --> 28:50.108
To tell the truth,
I have an even more drastic idea.

28:50.192 --> 28:51.527
<i>Fantastic!</i>

28:51.610 --> 28:53.237
But...

28:53.320 --> 28:56.490
I wonder if it would be
all right for Mima...

28:56.532 --> 28:58.951
or rather, her agency.

29:07.084 --> 29:09.169
Mima's character,
Yoko Takakura, changes...

29:09.211 --> 29:13.173
personalities completely when she's
raped by the customers at a strip show.

29:13.257 --> 29:16.343
You're crazy! A rape scene!?

29:16.426 --> 29:19.239
She's the key figure in the second half
of the series! It's an important role!

29:19.263 --> 29:21.974
But Mima's a pop idol!

29:22.724 --> 29:24.393
Don't worry, Mima.

29:24.476 --> 29:27.396
We'll ask the producer and get it changed.

29:27.437 --> 29:29.565
Hey, hey. Wait a minute!

29:29.648 --> 29:33.110
The scripts are already behind schedule
as is, and the art staff is getting antsy!

29:33.151 --> 29:36.613
How will it look if we
make it worse by arguing?

29:36.697 --> 29:40.617
I even told Shibuya that she was
changing out from a pop idol!

29:40.701 --> 29:43.579
It's our job to protect the
celebrities in our agency!

29:43.620 --> 29:46.039
There's no way Mima can do such a thing!

29:46.081 --> 29:47.749
It's all right, Rumi.

29:48.417 --> 29:49.960
I'll do it.

29:50.043 --> 29:52.170
Because I decided that
I WILL become an actress.

29:52.254 --> 29:52.879
Mima!

29:52.963 --> 29:55.257
I see. You're really wonderful, Mima!

29:55.299 --> 30:00.262
This kind of thing is commonplace for
actresses! Jodie whatshername did it too!

30:00.304 --> 30:02.764
Mima, please think it out.

30:02.848 --> 30:04.826
Do you realize what will
happen as a result of this?

30:04.850 --> 30:08.437
It's not as if I'm really getting raped!

30:08.520 --> 30:11.898
Although... I'm sure my parents will
flip when they see me like that.

30:13.650 --> 30:17.571
Anyway, I'll do it.
I'll give it my best shot.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.574
Mima...

30:34.630 --> 30:36.465
<i>I absolutely REFUSE to do it!</i>

30:54.983 --> 30:58.612
Well, Mr. Director?
How does the set look?

30:58.695 --> 31:00.947
I'd prefer to shoot in a real club...

31:00.989 --> 31:04.660
but considering what we're filming,
nobody will let us shoot at their place.

31:04.701 --> 31:06.411
Sheesh!

31:06.995 --> 31:09.414
Please, I'm counting on you.

31:09.498 --> 31:13.251
Hey, hey, hey, come on, Yada!

31:13.335 --> 31:16.421
What are you going to do with just
the DATE of the next meeting!?

31:16.838 --> 31:20.050
That doesn't make for much of a meeting!

31:20.133 --> 31:21.426
<i>OK here!</i>

31:29.351 --> 31:31.895
We're ready to shoot!

31:32.688 --> 31:36.942
Scene 48, "The manager gets
dragged down", take 1!

31:37.401 --> 31:39.945
Ten seconds...

31:42.572 --> 31:46.201
5, 4, 3, 2...

32:08.265 --> 32:10.308
Mmmm! Looks good!

32:10.392 --> 32:13.270
Ex-pop idols sure make a nice scene!

32:14.312 --> 32:16.356
<i>No! Stop! Let me go!</i>

32:16.440 --> 32:18.316
<i>Cut it off! Get off the stage!</i>

32:18.400 --> 32:19.484
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

32:19.568 --> 32:21.045
<i>Get out of here! I'll call the police!</i>

32:21.069 --> 32:22.422
<i>You think I give a shit about cops?</i>

32:22.446 --> 32:23.155
<i>Stop!</i>

32:23.238 --> 32:24.489
<i>Hands off!</i>

32:24.573 --> 32:26.283
<i>Stop it!</i>

32:31.079 --> 32:33.331
Let me go! Stop it!

32:33.999 --> 32:36.543
Help! Help me! No!

32:45.594 --> 32:48.013
Please! NO!

32:48.388 --> 32:50.557
Cut!

32:53.518 --> 32:55.562
Hey, over there, hold your places!

32:59.858 --> 33:04.070
OK! Now move the cameras!

33:06.114 --> 33:07.949
I'm so sorry...

33:07.991 --> 33:09.576
Oh, no, it's all right.

33:10.368 --> 33:12.120
OK, next up, the rape scene!

33:12.204 --> 33:14.164
Everyone, get ready!

33:14.247 --> 33:16.917
Take 1! Rolling!

33:17.417 --> 33:22.422
No! Stop! No! No! Stop!

33:32.140 --> 33:35.477
Please! Stop!

33:35.519 --> 33:36.603
Cut!

33:37.729 --> 33:39.606
No, no, no! FASTER!

33:39.689 --> 33:41.650
Sorry!

33:41.733 --> 33:43.735
Once again, from the top!

33:43.819 --> 33:47.113
No break yet! Take 2!

33:53.370 --> 33:55.330
Please! Stop!

33:55.413 --> 33:57.749
No! Please! NO!

33:57.833 --> 34:00.126
Stop it! No!

34:14.182 --> 34:15.392
Please!

34:59.978 --> 35:03.231
Mimarin!!

35:26.421 --> 35:28.965
I'm so tired!

35:30.008 --> 35:32.636
Hey, where's Rumi?

35:32.802 --> 35:37.766
Hmm? Oh, she had a
meeting to go to for me...

35:37.849 --> 35:40.393
Hey, Mima...

35:40.477 --> 35:42.646
You know...

35:47.192 --> 35:49.110
Nothing. You tried so hard...

35:49.152 --> 35:51.172
As a reward for your efforts,
I'll treat you to a delicious meal.

35:51.196 --> 35:52.197
Lucky me!

36:14.052 --> 36:17.055
I'm home, fishies!

36:17.138 --> 36:19.724
I wonder if you're hungry yet?

37:08.398 --> 37:11.026
Of course I didn't want to do it!

37:11.109 --> 37:13.945
But I couldn't trouble all the people
who brought me this far!!

37:16.865 --> 37:18.992
<i>See, didn't I tell you?</i>

37:20.160 --> 37:22.537
<i>Is that the job that what you wanted?</i>

37:22.579 --> 37:25.331
<i>That was the PITS!</i>

37:40.430 --> 37:42.265
<i>I don't want to do that drama anymore!</i>

37:42.348 --> 37:46.394
<i>The producer is a total pervert, and
my role is really screwed up!</i>

37:46.478 --> 37:51.024
<i>Singing in front of my fans has
GOT to be the best for me after all!</i>

38:01.701 --> 38:04.120
Oh... that scene?

38:04.162 --> 38:07.832
Of course I would be lying if I said
I didn't have any hesitations...

38:07.916 --> 38:12.796
but I looked at it as a hurdle
I had to jump over as an actress.

38:13.713 --> 38:15.757
I heard the ratings went up.

38:16.800 --> 38:19.761
As always,
the public at large are all idiots.

38:20.011 --> 38:22.931
Yes. I'd like to be
recognized as an actress.

38:22.972 --> 38:24.599
Not as "the ex-pop idol"?

38:24.641 --> 38:25.725
You got it!

38:26.017 --> 38:29.270
I was fine coz Rei was
always the one I liked.

38:29.312 --> 38:32.273
I'm sure all the Mimarin fans
are crying right about now.

38:32.732 --> 38:38.613
But CHAM did teach me a lot. It was
a great experience in its own way.

38:38.696 --> 38:39.823
Yeah, totally!

38:39.906 --> 38:43.576
They're probably whining,
"That's not Mimarin!"

38:53.711 --> 38:58.675
<i>Mima's Room</i>

38:59.759 --> 39:02.720
What was YOUR day like?

39:04.139 --> 39:05.699
"Today, I was still a little depressed..."

39:05.723 --> 39:09.269
"but receiving e-mail from all of
you made me feel a little better."

39:09.310 --> 39:10.770
E-mail?

39:10.812 --> 39:14.149
"June 24: Help me, everyone..."

39:15.358 --> 39:20.572
"Everyone is forcing me to do it!
It's all the screenwriter's fault!"

39:20.655 --> 39:22.007
<i>Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!</i>

39:22.031 --> 39:25.493
This... This isn't true!
I'm not writing any of this!

39:25.535 --> 39:29.247
<i>Of course!
The REAL Mima is writing this!</i>

39:31.875 --> 39:35.253
<i>I know that deep down in your heart
you want to be a pop idol again.</i>

39:35.336 --> 39:36.336
No!

39:36.379 --> 39:38.298
I'm no longer...

39:38.339 --> 39:40.383
<i>No longer what?</i>

39:40.466 --> 39:43.845
<i>Oh, yeah, you're no longer a pop idol.</i>

39:43.887 --> 39:46.931
<i>You're a filthy woman now.</i>

39:47.015 --> 39:50.643
<i>Nobody likes idols with
tarnished reputations!</i>

39:50.685 --> 39:52.562
That's not true! That's not true!

39:52.645 --> 39:55.315
Mimarin!

39:59.819 --> 40:03.823
<i>You can't step back into
that spotlight now...</i>

40:06.034 --> 40:08.661
<i>But that's all right. I'M here.</i>

40:10.622 --> 40:14.667
<i>From now on, I'll be in the light,
and you'll be in the shadows.</i>

40:16.711 --> 40:18.046
What are you saying!?

40:18.087 --> 40:20.173
Who in the world are you!?

40:20.632 --> 40:22.550
<i>Nobody likes you anymore.</i>

40:22.592 --> 40:24.886
<i>You're tarnished! FILTHY!</i>

40:24.969 --> 40:26.888
Stop! Stop it!

40:26.930 --> 40:29.807
I am not tarnished!

40:30.225 --> 40:31.434
Wait!

40:31.517 --> 40:33.519
WAIT!

41:16.813 --> 41:20.149
Love makes your heart race.

41:20.233 --> 41:23.403
If it means you're loved in the end...

41:23.444 --> 41:26.572
be much more aggressive...

41:26.656 --> 41:29.951
because you will get a chance.

41:30.034 --> 41:35.623
The angel of love smiles at you.

41:35.707 --> 41:38.209
Is anyone there?

41:47.010 --> 41:50.513
Can you see the angel's white wings?

41:50.596 --> 41:54.976
Or her eyes gazing at you...

41:55.059 --> 41:59.105
her sweet voice, her gentle hands?

41:59.188 --> 42:03.484
She is here just for you.

42:03.568 --> 42:07.864
She is protecting you...

42:07.947 --> 42:11.951
from somewhere nearby.

42:12.035 --> 42:16.622
Got a question about...

42:16.664 --> 42:20.335
Love makes your heart race.

42:20.418 --> 42:23.588
If it means you're loved in the end...

42:23.671 --> 42:26.632
be much more aggressive...

43:03.002 --> 43:05.671
It happened about
1 o'clock this morning.

43:06.464 --> 43:09.592
Hey, I called you last
night and you weren't in...

43:09.675 --> 43:13.638
"Oh shit! How did you know?"
Yeah, right.

43:13.721 --> 43:15.723
Did you see "Mima's Room"?

43:15.807 --> 43:18.393
Yeah, but is that really her?

43:18.476 --> 43:20.103
No clue.

43:20.186 --> 43:22.939
According to that page,
Mimarin's gonna be on stage today.

43:23.022 --> 43:24.482
No way!

43:25.024 --> 43:29.736
<i>Police say Shibuya was stabbed umpteen

43:32.657 --> 43:37.203
It sure is a shocking incident, but
us worrying about it won't help.

43:37.245 --> 43:38.847
We have to put our minds on something else.

43:38.871 --> 43:41.707
But there was that letter bomb too...

43:42.708 --> 43:46.212
You think Mr. Shibuya's murder
is connected with that?

43:47.130 --> 43:50.007
I didn't say that...

43:50.091 --> 43:54.554
You watch too many TV tabloid shows.
Don't worry about it.

43:54.637 --> 43:58.724
You won't become a star
looking like that! Smile!

44:00.101 --> 44:03.229

What's wrong? Mima! MIMA!

44:27.086 --> 44:30.089
But will Mima be all right?

44:30.131 --> 44:31.591
Why?

44:31.632 --> 44:35.011
That photographer specializes
in getting people to strip!

44:35.094 --> 44:36.762
So what?

44:36.804 --> 44:39.015
She's got that part down pat!

44:39.098 --> 44:41.851
I'm sure she's totally showing it
off in front of the photographer!

44:41.934 --> 44:43.394
Like, TOTALLY!

44:43.478 --> 44:45.938
Isn't it time you were on? Hurry up.

44:46.022 --> 44:48.274
Yes'm.

44:55.656 --> 44:57.617
Oooh... I like that expression.

44:57.700 --> 44:59.344
Try running your fingers through your hair.

44:59.368 --> 45:01.621
Oh, I like this.

45:01.704 --> 45:04.081
It's great!

Great. Now let's take the top off too...

45:21.724 --> 45:25.478
<i>I'd rather wear jeans...</i>

<i>This year, I'll not exert
myself and dress casually.</i>

46:12.233 --> 46:14.735

46:14.777 --> 46:17.154
Hey Mima, are you listening?

46:17.238 --> 46:20.324
Stop all this nonsense! Who are you!?

46:20.408 --> 46:23.494
<i>Me? I'm a pop idol.</i>

46:23.578 --> 46:25.621
<i>Everyone's waiting for me.</i>

46:25.705 --> 46:29.542
<i>So I'm going to sing with
Rei and Yukiko again.</i>

46:29.584 --> 46:31.085
No, I'm not!

46:31.127 --> 46:33.671
I'm an actress!

46:33.838 --> 46:35.089
<i>Don't be silly!</i>

46:35.131 --> 46:37.425
<i>No one really wants that!</i>

Wait!

46:39.093 --> 46:40.678
<i>What everyone wants is...</i>

46:40.761 --> 46:44.724
<i>from comics than difficult books and...</i>

<i>I want to stay the way I am forever.</i>

Hey!

48:02.134 --> 48:04.303

48:37.878 --> 48:40.297
<i>Of course.

48:59.024 --> 49:02.987
<i>I'll get rid of her.</i>

49:10.035 --> 49:12.997
<i>You're the only one I can depend on.</i>

49:23.215 --> 49:27.219
I don't know anything about myself anymore!

49:27.636 --> 49:28.596
Well...

49:28.637 --> 49:31.599
How do you think you know
that person you were...

49:31.640 --> 49:34.643
a second ago is the
same person you are now?

49:35.728 --> 49:37.813
A continuous stream of memories.

49:37.897 --> 49:41.317
Given only that, we all create
illusions within ourselves...

49:41.400 --> 49:44.862
saying that we each have
only one fixed persona.

49:44.945 --> 49:47.531
Doctor, I'm scared...

49:47.615 --> 49:51.202
that my other self will do something
that I don't know about...

49:52.161 --> 49:56.707
It's all right. There is no way
illusions can come to life.

50:01.837 --> 50:02.837
CUT!

50:04.423 --> 50:06.175
Mima, what's wrong?

50:06.258 --> 50:07.968
I'm sorry!

50:08.052 --> 50:10.846
Oh, man! This rain sucks!

50:10.930 --> 50:12.306
I think I'm going to catch a cold!

50:12.389 --> 50:14.683
I'm sorry!

50:22.483 --> 50:25.486
Wrap it up! Wrap it up!!

50:31.200 --> 50:36.705
It's pouring really badly outside, but
your heart is always, like, sunny!

50:36.789 --> 50:38.290
Well, I think we're ready today!

50:38.374 --> 50:38.958

50:47.424 --> 50:49.176
I'm sure they're on the air now.

50:49.218 --> 50:51.378
I thought you'd like to see
them coz it's been a while.

50:54.390 --> 51:00.354
We have a show this Sunday.
It's at Ibaragi Sim City at 2pm.

51:00.437 --> 51:02.165

<i>- People from all over, come see us!</i>

51:02.189 --> 51:05.568

<i>- We'll be waiting for you!</i>

<i>Chamland will be back next week
at the same time. Until then...</i>

It feels like I haven't
seen you in a long time.

52:54.802 --> 52:56.887
Well, I've been busy too.

52:56.971 --> 52:59.682
So, are you getting used to acting?

52:59.765 --> 53:01.100
Yeah.

53:01.183 --> 53:04.228
It's hard, but I chose to do it.

53:05.521 --> 53:07.648
You've matured quite a bit, Mima!

53:07.731 --> 53:11.235

seem to like the new Mima.

53:12.611 --> 53:14.238
Yeah...

53:15.531 --> 53:18.075
That doesn't look like
a face that's agreeing.

You know... Mima...
Has someone been harassing you?

53:23.831 --> 53:26.750
I've been visiting that home page.

53:27.167 --> 53:30.504
It's a bit much, even if it's a complaint
about how you changed your image...

53:31.422 --> 53:33.424
It's better if you didn't look at it.

53:33.507 --> 53:34.925
Yeah...

53:35.009 --> 53:37.428
But maybe she is more like me than myself.

53:37.511 --> 53:39.179
Mima?

53:39.221 --> 53:42.349
My other self that I buried
deep within my heart.

53:42.391 --> 53:43.434
What if...

53:43.517 --> 53:47.021
What if that other personality suddenly
started acting on its own?

53:47.104 --> 53:51.150
It's all right. There is no way
illusions can come to life.

53:51.233 --> 53:51.775
Rumi?

53:51.859 --> 53:52.693

You're bleeding!

55:06.100 --> 55:08.936
This blood is real, isn't it?

55:09.019 --> 55:10.771
Mima!

55:14.566 --> 55:17.046
Today I went shopping in Harajuku.
I'm a sucker for sale items.

55:23.867 --> 55:27.037
I guess... I went to Harajuku today...

55:34.837 --> 55:36.213
You mean...

55:36.296 --> 55:39.633
the murderer is an illusion she created?

55:39.716 --> 55:40.716
Yes.

55:41.510 --> 55:43.846
She fears an imaginary security guard...

55:43.929 --> 55:48.600
and then doubles that figure with
the serial murderer of top models.

55:49.143 --> 55:51.645
But illusions don't kill.

55:52.771 --> 55:56.942
But... what if that illusion found
someone to possess?

55:57.025 --> 55:58.485
Possess??

55:58.569 --> 56:00.863
<i>Then... all those men who got murdered?</i>

56:00.946 --> 56:04.658
<i>Were those who were no
longer of any use to her.</i>

56:05.826 --> 56:08.412
<i>Find her quickly, Mr. Yamashiro.</i>

56:08.495 --> 56:12.124
<i>Before another victim falls prey.</i>

56:15.627 --> 56:18.005
How much?

56:22.551 --> 56:25.179
You sure are a weird pizza man.

57:00.714 --> 57:03.467
Stop! Please stop!

57:15.270 --> 57:19.399
Yeah, that looks good... Come on,
be more daring! More passionate!

57:32.496 --> 57:33.872
All right! Take three!

57:51.932 --> 57:52.766
- Hello?
<i>- Mima?</i>

57:52.808 --> 57:55.310
Are you all right over there?

57:55.352 --> 57:57.604
You haven't heard yet... about Mr. Murano?

58:00.482 --> 58:01.608
Can't be!

58:02.693 --> 58:05.904
<i>Police say that Murano died
of multiple stab wounds...</i>

58:05.988 --> 58:07.823
Mr. Murano!? Really!?

58:07.864 --> 58:11.118
We're going crazy here!

58:11.702 --> 58:14.955
Anyway, stay put until
I get there. All right!?

58:14.997 --> 58:18.458
<i>The weapon used in the latest murder
is said to closely resemble...</i>

58:18.542 --> 58:22.170
<i>the one used in last week's killing
of a popular screenwriter.</i>

58:22.254 --> 58:26.049
<i>Police are considering a personal
grudge as the motive...</i>

58:26.133 --> 58:30.137
<i>and are looking into connections
between the two cases.</i>

59:00.584 --> 59:04.838
Miss Kirigoe! Please, can we get your
opinion about the murder of Mr. Murano?

59:04.880 --> 59:06.548
Do you know anything?

59:06.631 --> 59:10.427
Isn't there a connection with the killing
of Mr. Shibuya the screenwriter?

59:10.510 --> 59:13.430
Miss Kirigoe!
There are rumors of a love triangle...

59:13.513 --> 59:16.516
between you, Mr. Shibuya,
and Mr. Murano and we...

59:21.855 --> 59:23.982
You think she's jinxed?

59:24.066 --> 59:26.234
What happens twice happens thrice.

59:26.318 --> 59:28.111
Let's take bets on who's next.

59:28.195 --> 59:29.654
Cut it out!

59:29.738 --> 59:32.574
Don't mind them.

59:32.657 --> 59:35.535
Am I alive?

59:35.577 --> 59:42.042
Maybe that truck hit me...
and this is all a dream...

59:42.125 --> 59:44.461
Everyone ready?

59:44.544 --> 59:46.922
OK. Mima!

59:52.969 --> 59:55.847
Breathe harder than during rehearsal.

59:55.931 --> 59:58.100
You've just killed someone.

59:58.183 --> 59:59.935
Yes.

01:00:11.279 --> 01:00:13.865
And... action!

01:00:22.582 --> 01:00:25.127
Are you awake?

01:00:27.963 --> 01:00:29.131
You are?

01:00:29.214 --> 01:00:31.716
Can you tell me your name?

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:35.595
Me? I'm Mima Kirigoe.

01:00:35.637 --> 01:00:37.556
Okay. And what do you do?

01:00:37.639 --> 01:00:41.726
I'm a pop idol... no, an actress.

01:00:42.352 --> 01:00:44.521
<i>That must be hard work.</i>

01:00:44.604 --> 01:00:48.191
<i>It's hard, but it's what I chose to do.</i>

01:00:49.151 --> 01:00:53.530
She thinks she's a new young
actress named Mima Kirigoe.

01:00:57.993 --> 01:01:01.121
Dissociative Identity Disorder.

01:01:01.913 --> 01:01:04.082
In other words,
"multiple personality syndrome."

01:01:04.166 --> 01:01:09.087
All those crimes took place when
she was some other persona.

01:01:09.171 --> 01:01:12.424
So where's the persona
of the original Yoko?

01:01:12.507 --> 01:01:15.051
Yoko Takakura, the original persona...

01:01:15.135 --> 01:01:19.431
is nothing more than a character
in a drama for her.

01:01:20.182 --> 01:01:24.686
Being a "normal" girl... how she
was raped in a strip club...

01:01:24.769 --> 01:01:27.272
Everything happened as
part of her drama series.

01:01:27.355 --> 01:01:30.901
By doing so, she salvaged her heart.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:37.073
That's right. I'm an actress.

01:01:37.657 --> 01:01:39.784
Cut!

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.247
<i>Can you tell me your name?</i>

01:01:44.331 --> 01:01:47.667
<i>Me? I'm Rika Takakura.</i>

01:01:48.293 --> 01:01:52.088
The original persona,
Yoko Takakura, no longer exists.

01:01:52.172 --> 01:01:58.261
By killing, and later becoming, her sister
the top-model, she salvaged her heart.

01:02:01.306 --> 01:02:04.601
That's right. I'm a model.

01:02:04.684 --> 01:02:07.854
All right! That's the take!

01:02:17.531 --> 01:02:19.324
We did it, Mima!

01:02:19.407 --> 01:02:22.869
Mima... Good work!

01:02:22.953 --> 01:02:24.788
I can tell you tried so hard!

01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:26.206
Rumi...

01:02:26.248 --> 01:02:30.752
As of this moment,
Double Bind is in the can!

01:02:30.835 --> 01:02:33.213
Everyone, great job!

01:02:51.273 --> 01:02:54.234
You were fantastic, Mima!
What do you think, Director?

01:02:54.317 --> 01:02:56.528
She really was excellent.

01:02:56.611 --> 01:02:58.238
Thanks a lot.

01:02:58.280 --> 01:02:59.864
See you at the wrap-up party.

01:02:59.948 --> 01:03:03.076
We'll be talking to you.

01:03:03.118 --> 01:03:04.911
Then... shall we go as well?

01:03:04.953 --> 01:03:07.372
Mima, go get changed.

01:03:22.804 --> 01:03:23.555
Dr. Touko...

01:03:23.638 --> 01:03:27.851
Hey now! I'm not Touko anymore!
Did you forget?

01:03:27.934 --> 01:03:32.314
"There is no way illusions
can come to life."

01:03:32.397 --> 01:03:34.858
You should stop dreaming soon.

01:03:46.453 --> 01:03:47.954
Eri?

01:03:51.333 --> 01:03:53.585
What's taking Mima so long?

01:03:53.668 --> 01:03:57.797
I'm going back to the office.
Take Mima home, will ya?

01:03:57.881 --> 01:04:01.468
Mr. Tadokoro. You were saying something
about Mima's next job?

01:04:02.427 --> 01:04:04.471
Oh, it's great!

01:04:04.512 --> 01:04:06.139
A starring role in a video movie.

01:04:06.222 --> 01:04:10.602
There are a few sketchy scenes...
but what can you do?

01:04:14.564 --> 01:04:16.775
Somebody help me!

01:04:18.443 --> 01:04:22.113
Like anyone can hear
YOUR voice right now!

01:04:24.449 --> 01:04:25.492
Who are you!?

01:04:25.575 --> 01:04:26.868
Why are you doing this!?

01:04:26.951 --> 01:04:29.704
I'm protecting my dear Mimarin!

01:04:29.788 --> 01:04:32.123
But-But I'm Mima!

01:04:34.042 --> 01:04:36.002
No, no, no, no, NO!

01:04:36.086 --> 01:04:38.838
You didn't know I was Me-mania!

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.300
You're just PRETENDING to be Mimarin!

01:04:42.384 --> 01:04:43.426
STOP!

01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:45.887
NO! STOP!

01:04:50.517 --> 01:04:54.020
Did you fool that screenwriter and that
photographer with this little mouth?

01:04:54.062 --> 01:04:56.648
You tarnished Mimarin's name!

01:04:58.149 --> 01:05:00.819
Can it be... that you...

01:05:00.902 --> 01:05:04.531
The real Mimarin e-mails me every day!

01:05:04.614 --> 01:05:06.574
And she says that you
keep getting in her way!

01:05:06.616 --> 01:05:08.493
You killed them!?

01:05:08.576 --> 01:05:10.704
And you'll die soon, too!

01:05:24.759 --> 01:05:26.052
Bad girl!

01:05:26.136 --> 01:05:29.431
You have to follow the script!

01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:34.436
And now... TAKE 2!

01:07:10.532 --> 01:07:12.492
All right! Looks good!!

01:07:16.037 --> 01:07:18.540
You're the best, Mima!

01:07:35.682 --> 01:07:37.725
Mima!

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.687
What's wrong? You're in shambles!

01:07:40.770 --> 01:07:43.606
I was looking all over for you!

01:07:43.690 --> 01:07:44.482
Rumi...

01:07:44.566 --> 01:07:47.026
What in the world happened?

01:07:58.162 --> 01:08:00.123
This can't be!!

01:08:00.206 --> 01:08:04.043
Are you sure you weren't dreaming?

01:08:14.929 --> 01:08:17.140
Are you all right?

01:08:17.223 --> 01:08:20.894
I'm taking you back... to Mima's room.

01:08:41.497 --> 01:08:43.666
Rumi, are you here?

01:08:43.750 --> 01:08:45.084
What?

01:08:45.168 --> 01:08:47.712
Oh, nothing...

01:08:49.255 --> 01:08:51.716
Oh, that's right,
I have to call Mr. Tadokoro.

01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:56.197
No... This isn't my room...

01:09:56.239 --> 01:09:59.784
<i>Of course not! This is Mima's room!</i>

01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:02.537
You're!

01:10:02.578 --> 01:10:05.873
Look! It's the new costume!

01:10:06.958 --> 01:10:09.002
I'm wearing it at tomorrow's show!

01:10:09.085 --> 01:10:12.505
Isn't it great? It's perfect on me!

01:10:14.966 --> 01:10:16.884
Rumi? Why?

01:10:18.886 --> 01:10:20.680
Rumi?

01:10:20.722 --> 01:10:23.349
Rumi...

01:10:23.391 --> 01:10:25.727
Oh! Rumi went home.

01:10:25.768 --> 01:10:28.146
She said she's been busy lately
and was deprived of sleep.

01:10:28.229 --> 01:10:30.690
Don't say weird stuff like that!

01:10:30.773 --> 01:10:32.316
This is a joke, isn't it, Rumi!?

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:35.695
Love makes your heart race.

01:10:35.737 --> 01:10:39.699
If it means you're loved in the end...

01:10:39.741 --> 01:10:41.743
What do you think? Perfect, huh?

01:10:41.784 --> 01:10:44.662
A pop idol HAS to sing, after all!

01:10:44.746 --> 01:10:46.122
But...

01:10:46.205 --> 01:10:48.332
You just had to keep getting in my way.

01:10:48.416 --> 01:10:50.668
Rumi was totally furious, too.

01:10:50.752 --> 01:10:53.546
Please... stop all of this!

01:10:53.588 --> 01:10:57.842
But a pop idol is always
protected by her fans!

01:10:57.925 --> 01:11:01.095
They listen to any favor
I, Mima, ask them!

01:11:01.179 --> 01:11:04.766
Although Mr. Me-mania failed a wee bit...

01:11:04.849 --> 01:11:08.603
Me-mania?
How do you know him!?

01:11:09.228 --> 01:11:14.108
But, oh, well..." you reap what you
sow," especially about YOU.

01:12:56.127 --> 01:12:58.880
Help! Somebody help me!

01:13:11.559 --> 01:13:13.728
Please! Rumi, it's you, isn't it!?

01:13:13.811 --> 01:13:15.229
PLEASE WAKE UP!

01:13:15.313 --> 01:13:18.232
YOU'RE the one who needs to wake up!

01:13:24.697 --> 01:13:27.575
Help, help, somebody!

01:13:28.075 --> 01:13:31.037
Help! SOMEBODY HELP ME!

01:13:35.249 --> 01:13:38.544
SOMEBODY! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!

01:13:42.089 --> 01:13:45.218
HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!

01:14:14.789 --> 01:14:16.791
Let's end all of this.

01:14:16.874 --> 01:14:19.126
We don't need two Mimas!

01:14:19.210 --> 01:14:20.878
I AM MIMA!

01:14:21.963 --> 01:14:25.049
That's funny! Mima is a pop idol!

01:14:25.132 --> 01:14:27.468
You're just a dirty old impostor!

01:14:27.551 --> 01:14:31.430
LIKE I CARE! I AM WHO I AM!!

01:15:40.708 --> 01:15:41.584
Oh, shit!

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:44.003
Get the police!
No, call an ambulance!

01:15:44.086 --> 01:15:46.339
I know!

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:48.317
Thank you for the flowers you always bring.

01:16:48.401 --> 01:16:50.194
I'll put them in my room.

01:16:50.236 --> 01:16:53.823
They're pretty. Very pretty...

01:17:00.246 --> 01:17:04.583
I didn't know you were visiting.
You must be very busy lately.

01:17:04.625 --> 01:17:05.751
Oh, no.

01:17:05.835 --> 01:17:09.797
Once in a while, she returns
to her Rumi persona, but...

01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.259
I know I'll never see HER ever again.

01:17:13.676 --> 01:17:18.764
But, thanks to her,
I am who I am today.

01:17:28.482 --> 01:17:31.944
You're lying! There's no way Mima
Kirigoe would be HERE of all places!

01:17:31.986 --> 01:17:33.946
I guess she was just a look-alike.

01:17:43.164 --> 01:17:45.583
No, I'm real!

01:18:02.808 --> 01:18:08.856
<i>Each time I pass this
station on the train...</i>

01:18:08.939 --> 01:18:16.322
<i>my heart fills with nostalgia.</i>

01:18:16.405 --> 01:18:24.405
<i>The days when I ran around town,
hiding all of my feelings...</i>

01:18:26.874 --> 01:18:31.003
<i>in my school uniform.</i>

01:18:31.045 --> 01:18:37.718
<i>Take me to the first time I was in love...</i>

01:18:37.801 --> 01:18:45.801
<i>those four seasons when
I was frantic yet doubtful.</i>

01:18:45.893 --> 01:18:52.566
<i>Remember all those times when
just being near each other...</i>

01:18:52.650 --> 01:19:00.650
<i>kept our love for each other growing?</i>

01:19:17.341 --> 01:19:23.264
<i>I cut my hair after graduation.</i>

01:19:23.347 --> 01:19:30.854
<i>I wonder if you are still the same.</i>

01:19:30.896 --> 01:19:38.896
<i>Are you still pursuing that dream
that you kept telling me about...</i>

01:19:41.282 --> 01:19:45.369
<i>on the way home?</i>

01:19:45.452 --> 01:19:52.251
<i>Take me to when my tears overflowed...</i>

01:19:52.293 --> 01:20:00.293
<i>to those four seasons that
I felt from the bottom of my heart.</i>

01:20:00.384 --> 01:20:07.057
<i>Remember how in the sunsets after school...</i>

01:20:07.141 --> 01:20:15.141
<i>we just wanted time to spend alone?</i>

<i>Even in this new season, I can't shake...</i>

01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:44.920
<i>the habit of bluffing when I am sad.</i>

01:20:45.095 --> 01:20:51.727
<i>I'm sure that you knew.</i>

01:20:51.810 --> 01:20:59.810
<i>I still remember your eyes when
you looked at me silently.</i>
