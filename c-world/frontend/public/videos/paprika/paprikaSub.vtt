00:51.468 --> 00:54.756
It's the greatest show time!

01:22.249 --> 01:23.580
There's no doubt.

01:23.750 --> 01:26.332
He's here. “Who?

01:28.714 --> 01:31.330
Be careful he's a traitor.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.466
There's someone who keeps
looking at you. See?

01:36.680 --> 01:39.012
It's okay, he's a friend.

01:39.182 --> 01:43.266
Please turn your attention
to this gentleman!

01:43.437 --> 01:47.601
Now, one, two, three!

01:54.990 --> 01:56.446
There he is! Get him!

02:14.551 --> 02:16.132
Grab my hand!

02:20.724 --> 02:22.134
I let him get away again!

02:22.309 --> 02:24.641
Aren't you the one who got away?

02:37.616 --> 02:39.572
One more time!

02:39.910 --> 02:41.525
Take that!

03:22.119 --> 03:24.952
But what about the rest of it?

03:43.306 --> 03:47.049
You were in my dream.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.808
Everyone is startled at first.

03:53.650 --> 03:55.515
The DC mini.

03:55.694 --> 03:59.778
It's the scientific key that allows us
to open the door to our dreams.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.274
It can even do all this?

04:05.662 --> 04:07.823
It really is a dream machine.

04:07.998 --> 04:11.786
To tell you the truth,
the DC mini is still incomplete.

04:11.960 --> 04:17.296
Once complete, we'll be able to enter
your dream even while awake.

04:19.301 --> 04:21.007
You said he was a friend.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.637
We used to work together.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.557
Why did he put you in a cage?

04:29.728 --> 04:31.343
I don't know.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.972
He's not the kind of person
who would trick me.

04:38.153 --> 04:40.269
Why are they all me?

04:41.406 --> 04:44.022
That was really disturbing.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.449
This is Tarzan, right?

04:46.620 --> 04:49.453
This is a scene from
a spy movie, perhaps?

04:50.040 --> 04:53.282
The fighting was rather fun.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.997
Rem sleep that occurs
later during the sleep cycle...

04:57.172 --> 04:59.834
Is longer and easier to analyze.

05:00.008 --> 05:03.421
If earlier cycles are, say,
artsy film shorts...

05:03.595 --> 05:07.679
Later cycles are like feature-length
blockbuster movies.

05:07.849 --> 05:14.391
Then that makes you
a dream movie star.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.397
Do you not like movies?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.558
It's not that.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.270
What is this?

05:23.448 --> 05:26.235
The victim in the homicide case
I'm working on right now.

05:27.410 --> 05:33.497
I haven't been able to catch the perp,
so maybe that's why ll...

05:33.667 --> 05:36.955
- Your anxiety neurosis.
- Do you think this is the source?

05:37.587 --> 05:39.202
No need to rush.

05:39.381 --> 05:42.123
The treatment's just getting started.

05:44.970 --> 05:48.758
Take care, captain konakawa.

05:55.647 --> 05:58.059
When can I see you again?

08:12.450 --> 08:15.567
I'm in a bind.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.663
- I can see that.
- No, it's not that.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.040
I was on my way to see you.

08:26.006 --> 08:29.624
It's not that! The DC mini!

08:31.761 --> 08:35.094
It was stolen? The DC mini?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.756
We found out this morning.

08:37.934 --> 08:41.597
Three samples in Dr. tokita's
possession were stolen.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.725
But why?

08:44.899 --> 08:48.266
We'll worry about the reason later.
We need to find them now.

08:49.612 --> 08:52.069
Do you think it's internal?

08:53.658 --> 08:55.398
Unfortunately.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.280
We'll talk about that later.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.815
Foundation for
psychiatric research

09:00.790 --> 09:03.406
meet me in my office.
We'll figure out a plan...

09:04.419 --> 09:06.785
Before the chairman finds out.

09:06.963 --> 09:10.626
Yes, we have to protect
the DC mini.

09:15.638 --> 09:20.257
It's too bad it was stolen, but all
we have to do is make another one.

09:20.435 --> 09:24.144
You should know better than anyone
what can happen if it's misused.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.475
You invented it.

09:27.275 --> 09:31.268
I make it, but how it's used
is your job, at-chan.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.988
Don't call me at-chan.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.827
There is one more problem.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.700
Good grief.

09:46.878 --> 09:51.417
I hadn't programmed the access
controls into the DC mini yet.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.545
Translate that for me.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.677
It means that the person
who stole the DC mini

09:57.847 --> 10:02.841
can connect to a psychotherapy
machine at any time, from any place...

10:03.019 --> 10:06.637
And use it to intrude into the minds
connected to that machine.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.476
Chief's office

10:08.650 --> 10:12.268
I see. We have to hurry.

10:21.663 --> 10:26.077
It is man's responsibility
to control science and technology.

10:26.251 --> 10:27.707
Chairman.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.419
Sharing in another's dream.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.796
It is quite literally
a technological dream...

10:33.967 --> 10:39.212
But, in time,
it can lead to violence.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.965
It was an invention that never
should have been created.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.342
This discussion again?

10:47.564 --> 10:49.976
The DC mini represents the hope...

10:50.150 --> 10:53.062
That shines on the new horizons
of psychiatric treatment.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.941
It is taking control over dreams.

10:57.115 --> 10:59.572
Your overconfidence
will bring weakness.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.824
It is not about control

11:01.995 --> 11:06.079
we are simply pursuing
a deeper connection with our patients.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.500
The terrorist who stole it
won't see it that way.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.753
But it hasn't even been misused yet.

11:18.261 --> 11:22.425
Thieves are not always wrong.

11:23.349 --> 11:24.839
Paprika.

11:25.768 --> 11:28.225
I hear there's a woman _.

11:28.396 --> 11:32.105
Wwho's been using the psychotherapy
machine for unapproved treatments.

11:32.609 --> 11:37.353
Are you going to believe
such groundless rumors, chairman?

11:37.614 --> 11:41.448
Discipline calls for a search of the
DC mini rather than paprika's bikini.

11:41.618 --> 11:43.108
This is true happiness.

11:44.996 --> 11:46.111
Discipline?

11:46.289 --> 11:51.534
Even the five court ladies danced
in sync to the frog's flutes and drums.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.624
The whirlwind of the recycled paper
was a sight to see.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.084
It was like computer graphics!

11:59.510 --> 12:03.844
The fact that I don't support technicolor
parfaits and snobby petit bourgeois...

12:04.015 --> 12:08.384
Is common knowledge in oceania!

12:08.561 --> 12:11.644
Now is the time to return home
to the blue sky!

12:12.398 --> 12:15.231
The confetti will dance around
the shrine gates.

12:15.401 --> 12:20.566
The mailbox and the refrigerator
will lead the way!

12:21.366 --> 12:25.405
Anyone who cares
about expiration dates...

12:25.578 --> 12:28.411
Will not get in the way
of the glory train!

12:29.165 --> 12:33.158
They need to fully realize
the liver of the triangle rulers!

12:34.003 --> 12:38.463
Now, this festival was decided
by the third-grade class...

12:38.633 --> 12:40.294
With the telephoto camera!

12:40.468 --> 12:42.800
Move forward! Come together!
I am the ultimate

12:43.346 --> 12:45.257
governor!

12:46.266 --> 12:47.301
Chief!

12:50.687 --> 12:52.928
Now! Right now!

12:54.023 --> 12:56.935
Take me in!

13:37.442 --> 13:38.648
How's the chief doing?

13:39.402 --> 13:42.144
His breathing and pulse are stable.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.399
I guess it could've been worse.

13:49.537 --> 13:51.778
Dr. chiba, here are
the chief's medical records.

13:51.956 --> 13:53.196
Thank you.

13:53.958 --> 13:57.246
He was probably using the
therapy machine to treat a patient...

13:57.420 --> 13:59.331
When someone used
a DC mini to intrude.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.172
And the dream was projected
into his subconscious.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.504
Without him knowing.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.419
But for that to happen...

14:08.014 --> 14:11.177
The culprit has to be watching
this nightmare too.

14:12.643 --> 14:14.258
What a desperate terrorist.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.677
All terrorists are desperate.

14:16.856 --> 14:22.271
The sun during midday
will light up the dark night.

14:22.445 --> 14:28.281
Night dreams of day.
Light dreams of darkness.

14:28.451 --> 14:31.238
But the ignorant sun...

14:31.412 --> 14:33.949
Will chase away the darkness
and burn the shadows.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.456
Eventually burning itself!

14:37.752 --> 14:38.958
Himuro!

14:41.047 --> 14:44.005
The shade of the tree
with the flowers that bloom at night...

14:44.175 --> 14:46.461
Is where the residents
of darkness rest

14:46.636 --> 14:47.967
why is himuro in there?

14:48.554 --> 14:52.297
The people of daytime
are not allowed!

14:56.270 --> 14:57.635
Where is himuro?

14:58.815 --> 15:02.808
He's been out for the past few days,
but I didn't think too much of it.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.023
Himuro tends to abandon
everything else...

15:07.198 --> 15:09.314
When he really gets
into something.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.901
Like doctor, like assistant.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.822
How could we have not
seen this coming?

15:20.086 --> 15:22.668
I thought he was my friend.

15:23.381 --> 15:28.842
A genius produces a lot more
than he realizes.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.501
More clearly, please.

15:31.013 --> 15:34.926
Himuro was jealous of Dr. tokita.

15:35.101 --> 15:39.014
Even I feel bitter towards you
sometimes, Dr. chiba.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.521
No matter how hard I try,
I'm not as good as you.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.687
I feel powerless.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.037
It's open.

16:03.588 --> 16:06.830
- You mean you opened it.
- This is illegal, you know.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.215
I'm not as bad as himuro, though.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.224
Welcome home. Welcome back.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.325
He can't be serious.

16:58.476 --> 17:01.434
- This is dangerous.
- This isn't your cue.

18:34.864 --> 18:36.525
Anaphylaxis?

18:37.366 --> 18:39.823
Like an allergy?

18:41.370 --> 18:44.032
I can't think of any other reason.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.287
I got stung by a jellyfish
when I was a kid...

18:48.461 --> 18:51.373
And even now, I have
allergic reactions at the sight of one.

18:51.547 --> 18:55.836
It didn't occur to me until now.

18:56.010 --> 19:00.003
Here you go.
Who had the udon set?

19:00.765 --> 19:04.098
But the DC mini uses
3 transmission formula

19:04.268 --> 19:08.557
within the natural width
of the body's energy level.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.971
Who had the jumbo steak set?

19:11.776 --> 19:16.486
Depending on the frequency of use,
the body might adapt to it.

19:17.031 --> 19:20.615
And as a result, Dr. chiba,
who has had the most exposure...

19:20.785 --> 19:22.571
Was more susceptible
to invasion.

19:23.579 --> 19:28.073
Even when she wasn't connected
to the DC mini, nor was she asleep.

19:30.753 --> 19:32.914
Who had the paella”

19:33.798 --> 19:37.586
I think you have a problem too.
Like overeating.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.585
I can't fight on an empty stomach.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.596
Fight?

19:44.100 --> 19:48.594
Implanting dreams into
other people's heads is terrorism.

19:53.150 --> 19:57.018
At-chan, you said
that himuro and I were alike.

20:00.449 --> 20:04.783
I think so too. All the more reason
this is unforgivable.

20:10.668 --> 20:12.078
Hello?

20:13.963 --> 20:15.294
We'll be there immediately.

20:30.104 --> 20:31.844
Chief! Please, come back!

20:32.690 --> 20:35.853
Wake up! Chief!

20:36.819 --> 20:39.435
The delicious left brain
is getting older...

20:39.613 --> 20:42.446
And drifting to a faraway island.

20:49.790 --> 20:54.910
I, who stand before you,
am the protector of your dreams.

20:56.505 --> 21:01.340
I wonder what kind of punishment
will befall the ignorant commoner...

21:01.510 --> 21:04.798
Who tries to enter
this sacred dream?

21:12.188 --> 21:16.682
You're the feisty country girl
I saved some time ago.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.691
How are you?

21:20.654 --> 21:24.772
If he was not home
when I passed by around 7:30...

21:24.950 --> 21:28.158
Then he probably disappeared
into the instant noodle soup.

21:28.329 --> 21:30.490
Thank you for saving me.

21:31.332 --> 21:33.618
I have come to show you
my appreciation.

21:34.543 --> 21:35.953
Is it a square?

21:37.087 --> 21:38.543
No

21:40.841 --> 21:44.254
It's round, like this.

21:47.890 --> 21:50.006
I can feel it

21:52.186 --> 21:54.893
- paprika.
- Do you remember me now?

21:55.064 --> 21:57.396
I'm going to be a little rough.

21:58.317 --> 22:01.104
Paprika, what are you doing?

22:03.447 --> 22:05.938
Now, now, stop that.

22:19.964 --> 22:22.250
Welcome back, chief.

22:23.676 --> 22:28.090
I wonder where
that parade was going?

22:29.098 --> 22:32.590
A place of no return, most likely.

22:34.478 --> 22:39.222
I felt like I was really close...

22:39.400 --> 22:41.106
To controlling the entire world.

22:41.735 --> 22:45.353
That was a dream
of a severely delusional patient.

22:45.531 --> 22:50.446
While you were in there, your
brain waves and body deteriorated...

22:50.619 --> 22:52.280
Almost to the point of death.

22:52.955 --> 22:56.994
That's why paprika came.
Thank you.

22:57.167 --> 22:58.282
You haven't changed...

22:58.460 --> 23:02.794
Since the time you treated
my depression two years ago.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.089
I'll let paprika know.

23:09.346 --> 23:14.466
But to think that that honest himuro
was responsible.

23:14.643 --> 23:18.101
What should I do now, Dr. chiba?

23:18.606 --> 23:22.064
Please don't do anything. “What?

23:23.444 --> 23:27.153
The chairman will probably halt
the development of the DC mini...

23:27.323 --> 23:30.815
As a result of this incident.

23:31.660 --> 23:35.118
But with you, a board member,
in the hospital...

23:35.956 --> 23:38.493
They can't have a meeting.

23:43.714 --> 23:46.456
Hello? Oh, konakawa.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.008
How was the? You know.

23:50.179 --> 23:55.515
I would have asked sooner if I had
known that it would be this good.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.675
Remember, you can't tell anyone.

23:57.853 --> 23:59.969
I want to keep it a secret
all to myself.

24:00.689 --> 24:04.227
Paprika's existence
cannot become public...

24:04.401 --> 24:07.063
Until the psychotherapy machines
gain public approval.

24:07.237 --> 24:10.024
She really is
a woman of your dreams.

24:12.409 --> 24:15.196
Women of dreams
are busy these days.

24:15.371 --> 24:18.863
You look tired.
Want me to look in on your dreams?

24:21.377 --> 24:25.837
I haven't been seeing
any of my own lately.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.700
Welcome. We were waiting for you.

25:11.593 --> 25:13.049
Good evening.

25:18.934 --> 25:20.640
What is this place?

25:21.020 --> 25:26.014
A counseling room. A meeting place.
A date spot.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.309
Don't you think dreams
and the Internet are similar?

25:30.487 --> 25:33.479
They are both areas where
the repressed conscious mind vents.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.360
Here you go.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.786
Have you found anything?

25:50.799 --> 25:52.585
In regards to my dreams?

25:53.385 --> 25:54.545
You're so impatient.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.007
Do you work
at the research foundation?

26:02.186 --> 26:04.472
It was shima
who introduced me, after all.

26:04.646 --> 26:06.136
Where do you know mr shima from?

26:06.982 --> 26:09.644
He's a friend from college.

26:09.818 --> 26:13.151
We got along pretty well,
so we always hung out.

26:13.322 --> 26:16.405
Drinking and watching movies?

26:17.326 --> 26:21.319
No, movies don't interest me.

26:21.663 --> 26:23.369
I love them!

26:26.085 --> 26:27.416
Paprika”

26:29.505 --> 26:30.790
put it on my tab.

26:30.964 --> 26:32.750
Hey, paprika!

26:49.525 --> 26:51.140
Which one do you want to see?

26:52.778 --> 26:55.861
I'm sorry,
but movies really aren't my thing.

26:56.031 --> 26:58.238
Come on, hurry!

27:00.452 --> 27:01.783
I don't like movies!

27:09.336 --> 27:11.497
Hey, tsumura, stop...

27:11.672 --> 27:13.003
Breaking news!

27:13.173 --> 27:16.791
The widow who tells fortunes
in the shade of roof tiles!

27:16.969 --> 27:18.209
The response is sunny!

27:18.387 --> 27:19.797
The sign is good fortune!

27:19.972 --> 27:22.964
The ceiling fan brings a message
releasing epithets!

27:23.142 --> 27:25.554
The maiden who sleeps under
the veranda has a pulse!

27:25.727 --> 27:26.807
This is the way out!

27:26.979 --> 27:29.971
The secret of this view is deep
within the 10-year loan payment!

27:35.612 --> 27:37.568
They are new victims.

27:39.700 --> 27:41.691
I am stopping development.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.359
But the board meeting...

27:43.537 --> 27:46.324
The culprit won't wait
for a board meeting to happen.

27:46.498 --> 27:52.334
I am forbidding all use of the DC mini
and the psychotherapy machines.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.997
This is retribution.

27:58.135 --> 28:00.421
Science is nothing...

28:00.596 --> 28:05.761
But a piece of trash
before a profound dream.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.518
Are you okay?

28:19.156 --> 28:21.863
I heard the parts are non-recyclable.

28:23.202 --> 28:25.784
But that's an important piece
of equipment.

28:29.082 --> 28:30.788
I'll just have to make it again.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.785
He's a genius.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.881
He's a mysterious one, all right.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.630
You're giving him too much credit.

28:42.804 --> 28:45.011
He's just a kid inside.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.388
Dreamland

28:54.566 --> 28:58.354
it was a small theme park,
but I liked it as a kid.

28:58.528 --> 29:01.770
I used to talk about it with himuro.

29:26.223 --> 29:29.511
Do you really think himuro is here?

29:29.685 --> 29:31.596
If I knew, I wouldn't be searching.

29:32.437 --> 29:35.304
You're so cold, at-chan.

29:42.239 --> 29:44.195
I have a feeling he's near.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.027
Keep quiet, both of you.

30:16.898 --> 30:18.388
Watch out!

30:32.414 --> 30:34.075
Himuro?

30:36.335 --> 30:39.168
That's... “A DC mini.

30:57.064 --> 31:01.103
The high pressure holds the grab bag
and looks a lot like milk.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.156
The dense forest turns into
a shopping district.

31:03.320 --> 31:05.481
The 24-bit eggplant will be analyzed.

31:05.655 --> 31:09.273
So you're saying both of them were
attacked by way of the DC mini...

31:09.451 --> 31:12.318
Which broke their psyches.

31:12.913 --> 31:17.327
And the culprit, kei himuro, was
also disturbed by the nightmare...

31:17.501 --> 31:20.743
And tried to commit suicide.
Is that right?

31:22.089 --> 31:24.922
It's not because of the DC mini!

31:25.092 --> 31:30.507
It's just a little incomplete.
Himuro knew that

31:30.972 --> 31:35.432
I'm not refuting your invention.

31:43.151 --> 31:46.359
She's the head of
the DC mini development team.

31:46.530 --> 31:47.610
I'm chiba.

31:47.781 --> 31:50.488
This is Mr. konakawa
from the police department.

31:59.376 --> 32:00.616
Yes?

32:01.753 --> 32:03.618
Isn't it wonderful?

32:04.256 --> 32:08.090
The ability to see a friend's dream
as if it were your own.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.546
To share the same dream.

32:13.056 --> 32:16.548
Yes, it probably would be
a wonderful experience.

32:16.726 --> 32:18.682
You understand, right?

32:18.854 --> 32:22.938
It came to me during
a brain scan I was doing...

32:23.108 --> 32:26.316
Using a computer image processor.

32:26.945 --> 32:31.314
And you can use it to treat illness.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.607
That's exactly right!

32:33.785 --> 32:38.028
The nonlinear waves created by
surges in the bioelectrical current...

32:38.206 --> 32:41.949
Can be applied to create
new synapse connections...

32:42.127 --> 32:44.994
By adjusting the btu output.

32:46.089 --> 32:52.380
To use a person's body for energy
is a remarkable idea.

32:52.554 --> 32:54.795
Exactly! And the reason
why I focused...

32:54.973 --> 32:58.682
You are talking
with Dr. tokita, right?

33:02.772 --> 33:04.433
That's her, isn't it?

33:05.275 --> 33:07.140
Paprika.

33:10.071 --> 33:15.065
So, what do you think
about this case?

33:15.243 --> 33:18.201
Well, I think it's an accident.

33:18.914 --> 33:22.452
It's hard to build a case
against a dream.

33:24.169 --> 33:27.457
"Isn't it wonderful," eh?

33:28.215 --> 33:29.955
The bulky one.

33:31.343 --> 33:35.256
To think such a silly thought
would lead to such an invention.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.763
He's a kid trapped inside
the body of a genius.

33:38.934 --> 33:44.600
It's an adult's responsibility to steer
that genius in the right direction.

33:44.773 --> 33:46.434
Chairman.

33:47.442 --> 33:52.106
There is always conceit
and negligence behind misconduct.

33:55.617 --> 33:58.108
You have it hard too, I guess.

33:58.495 --> 33:59.951
Good grief.

34:00.539 --> 34:05.408
Where did I go wrong
to end up here?

34:05.877 --> 34:08.243
I want to go back
to our college days...

34:08.421 --> 34:12.460
Back to when we used to
talk about our futures.

34:22.143 --> 34:24.509
I want to go back
to our college days...

34:24.688 --> 34:28.727
Back to when we used to
talk about our futures.

34:57.512 --> 35:00.003
But what about the rest of it?

35:04.019 --> 35:05.179
It's too dangerous!

35:05.353 --> 35:08.891
Himuro went in
and he's not coming back.

35:09.065 --> 35:12.523
If the same happens to you...

35:14.029 --> 35:17.021
There are still two DC minis
out there.

35:17.198 --> 35:23.068
Our only lead is inside himuro.
And besides

35:23.246 --> 35:28.331
the chairman has already prohibited
the use of the therapy machines.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.415
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

35:32.589 --> 35:36.298
Don't worry.
The genius boy is here for backup.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.585
Dr. tokita again?

35:42.182 --> 35:45.891
I know that you two
established this field.

35:46.394 --> 35:50.888
So that's all the more reason for you
to place your trust in him...

35:51.066 --> 35:55.150
But his immaturity is the cause
of all these mishaps!

35:56.321 --> 35:59.063
That's why we'll make him
take responsibility.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.902
Besides, is there anyone else?

36:18.760 --> 36:21.502
This isn't the time for that.

36:21.680 --> 36:25.172
There are people in the world
that understand.

36:26.101 --> 36:30.185
That cop.
He has a mind for science.

36:30.355 --> 36:32.391
He doesn't seem
very smart, though.

36:33.066 --> 36:37.560
Now all I have to do is set the filtering
program for external access and...

36:40.782 --> 36:42.568
What was that for?

36:47.330 --> 36:50.197
Do you really think it was himuro?

36:52.377 --> 36:58.714
He's your assistant, and he knew
the risks involved with the DC mini.

36:59.175 --> 37:02.508
He knew what would happen
if he exposed himself for that long.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.715
What did he have to gain from it all?

37:04.889 --> 37:08.256
He was jealous of me.
Even osanai says so.

37:08.435 --> 37:11.302
He might be a victim too.

37:16.359 --> 37:19.317
That's like a line
from a mystery novel.

37:20.071 --> 37:23.188
If so, then it's still dangerous.
We need to confirm...

37:23.366 --> 37:25.027
No more talk

37:25.201 --> 37:28.568
what I need to do is finish this.

37:35.211 --> 37:37.418
You guys really are alike.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.999
At-chan?

37:39.174 --> 37:40.960
You and himuro.

37:41.134 --> 37:43.125
You get preoccupied
with what you want to do...

37:43.303 --> 37:45.419
And ignore what you have to do.

37:45.597 --> 37:50.011
Don't you understand
that your irresponsibility cost lives?

37:50.185 --> 37:54.519
Of course not.
Nothing can get through all that fat.

37:54.689 --> 37:58.273
And now what? "Isn't it wonderful”?
"A mind for science"?

37:58.443 --> 37:59.808
Don't make me laugh.

37:59.986 --> 38:03.570
How can a mad scientist
know what a human mind is?

38:03.740 --> 38:07.699
If you want to be the king of geeks
with your bloated ego...

38:07.869 --> 38:12.283
Then just keep up all this and
indulge in your freakish masturbation!

38:40.318 --> 38:42.684
And where is Mr. konakawa now?

38:42.862 --> 38:45.945
At a hotel it's all here.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.611
I'm counting on you.

39:05.552 --> 39:08.259
There's no doubt. He's here.

39:08.429 --> 39:10.545
You've crossed the line of action.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.596
Be careful he's a traitor.

39:15.770 --> 39:19.604
You need to narrow the exposure.
This is panfocus.

39:23.528 --> 39:27.692
Now, one, two, three!

39:31.286 --> 39:32.867
There he is! Get him!

39:44.841 --> 39:46.547
Welcome.

39:48.303 --> 39:50.168
What floor?

39:52.932 --> 39:55.719
The guy, I'm after him.

39:56.144 --> 39:59.557
Of course. The 14th floor.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.897
Fourteenth floor,
the adventure section.

40:11.910 --> 40:16.153
Fifteenth floor,
the suspense section.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.867
Sixteenth floor,
the romance section.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.411
One more time!

40:27.008 --> 40:29.169
Seventeenth floor,
the special section.

40:29.344 --> 40:30.675
No!

40:33.014 --> 40:34.424
I don't need to go there.

41:08.591 --> 41:10.832
Encore!

41:50.174 --> 41:54.133
I killed myself?

42:00.268 --> 42:02.759
That's like a line
from a mystery novel.

42:09.902 --> 42:13.565
It was a rush job,
but I put an access function on it.

42:15.908 --> 42:17.864
Morals, responsibilities...

42:18.036 --> 42:20.618
I don't really get that adults' stuff.

42:21.414 --> 42:24.247
But let's talk it over again.

42:25.460 --> 42:27.075
We're friends, right?

42:46.105 --> 42:48.061
Oh, jeez.

42:48.232 --> 42:52.817
Was making them not enough?
You had to become a doll yourself?

42:54.906 --> 42:56.897
Why did you steal it?

42:57.992 --> 43:01.905
Do you hate me that much?

43:03.081 --> 43:06.824
Or was it not you who did it?

43:07.001 --> 43:09.162
Fven with an access function.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.328
It's not one person's
dream anymore.

43:11.506 --> 43:14.498
That's right!
The DC mini was both our dreams!

43:14.675 --> 43:18.964
The crossing of two dreams
creates many more dreams.

43:19.555 --> 43:23.673
That's right! The entire development
team dreamt of its completion.

43:23.851 --> 43:25.716
This is a foolish place to be...

43:25.895 --> 43:28.352
To inquire about
the master of this dream.

43:28.523 --> 43:32.766
The conceit of the daytime residents
is what the nighttime residents want.

43:33.361 --> 43:38.822
To come in carelessly
is like a moth to a flame.

43:40.368 --> 43:42.654
You're not himuro, are you?

43:46.374 --> 43:50.708
What's the line of action
that clown was talking about?

43:51.295 --> 43:53.502
It's an imaginary line...

43:53.673 --> 43:57.086
That connects the subjects
on camera.

43:57.844 --> 44:01.052
If the camera crosses that line.

44:01.222 --> 44:03.804
The cut is awkward.

44:04.892 --> 44:06.803
That's why it has to be like this.

44:06.978 --> 44:09.185
I see. How about panfocus?

44:10.398 --> 44:13.014
It's a camera technique...

44:13.192 --> 44:17.731
Where you narrow the angle
to get the entire screen in focus.

44:18.281 --> 44:21.273
So you did like them.

44:21.450 --> 44:22.656
Movies

44:22.827 --> 44:26.786
are your dreams
in panfocus now too?

44:26.956 --> 44:30.164
Have you solved the mystery
of why you killed yourself?

44:32.461 --> 44:36.921
I've never thought of suicide.

44:37.091 --> 44:39.582
Maybe it's someone a lot like you.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.547
I ike me?

44:42.722 --> 44:45.088
Or another you.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.599
Another me?

45:01.449 --> 45:06.193
Paprika, is the inside of my head
this messed up?

45:06.829 --> 45:09.571
The dreams are merging.

45:11.083 --> 45:12.948
Tokita.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.994
He got started without me!

45:16.172 --> 45:18.879
- Walit! Tokita!
- Paprika!

45:20.218 --> 45:22.459
Why are you here?

45:22.637 --> 45:27.051
The ecstasy that blooms in synapse
is paprika-brand milk fat!

45:27.225 --> 45:28.886
Five percent is the norm.

45:32.521 --> 45:35.729
Tokita! No!

45:35.900 --> 45:38.061
The safety net of the ocean...

45:38.236 --> 45:40.693
Is nonlinear,
even with what crabs dream of!

45:40.863 --> 45:42.319
Let's go!

45:49.455 --> 45:50.786
Wake up!

45:59.257 --> 46:00.622
So you're saying...

46:00.800 --> 46:06.170
The dreams of tokita and himuro
merged into konakawa's dream?

46:06.973 --> 46:10.886
The anaphylaxis of the DC mini
is expanding exponentially!

46:11.686 --> 46:13.517
Just meet me at the lab.

46:24.031 --> 46:26.022
They're not dreaming?

46:26.742 --> 46:28.733
But they're in rem sleep.

46:29.704 --> 46:35.290
It's as if their conscious itself
has been taken away.

46:42.341 --> 46:44.798
I guess this calls for paprika.

46:46.178 --> 46:52.048
I'll dive into himuro's dream.
That's the only way to save tokita.

47:11.579 --> 47:13.069
Chief, can you hear me?

47:13.914 --> 47:17.577
Yeah, I hear you loud and clear.

47:18.252 --> 47:19.913
Any abnormalities?

47:20.087 --> 47:22.248
This dream is very dangerous.

47:23.424 --> 47:27.167
If anything happens to Atsuko,
use the awakening apparatus.

47:27.345 --> 47:31.133
Of course. But is it really safe?

47:31.307 --> 47:34.265
Tokita is gone because
he went into himuro's dream.

47:35.353 --> 47:36.763
Who do you think I am?

47:38.272 --> 47:41.014
- I'm sorry to have doubted you.
- There they are!

48:01.295 --> 48:03.786
Himuro isn't there.

48:05.049 --> 48:07.131
But it's his dream.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.384
Osanai?

49:46.442 --> 49:49.024
- Be careful.
- I eave it to me.

51:00.140 --> 51:01.971
Himuro.

51:35.134 --> 51:37.170
Wake her up!

51:40.055 --> 51:41.215
Chief! Hurry!

52:03.871 --> 52:07.864
That's not
himuro's dream anymore.

52:08.042 --> 52:10.784
So he was a victim too.

52:11.754 --> 52:15.497
He's an empty shell.

52:15.674 --> 52:18.962
He was invaded
by a collective dream.

52:19.553 --> 52:21.965
A collective dream?

52:22.139 --> 52:24.801
With no access restrictions

52:24.975 --> 52:28.467
the DC mini can be used to invade
any psychotherapy machine.

52:30.397 --> 52:33.639
Every dream it came in contact with
was eaten up...

52:33.817 --> 52:37.401
Into one huge delusion.

52:38.113 --> 52:41.697
And that delusion belongs to...

52:50.334 --> 52:56.045
This breath seethes
in the joy of life.

52:56.757 --> 53:00.545
I will not allow
arrogant scientific technology...

53:00.719 --> 53:05.338
To intrude in this holy ground.

53:06.600 --> 53:09.433
Return Dr. tokita to us.

53:10.979 --> 53:14.096
The dreams are horrified.

53:14.733 --> 53:20.103
That their safe refuge is
destroyed by technology.

53:22.241 --> 53:25.108
Are you going to punish him
like you did himuro?

53:26.161 --> 53:29.949
In a world of inhumane reality...

53:30.124 --> 53:34.788
It is the only
humane sanctuary left.

53:34.962 --> 53:36.793
That is a dream.

53:36.964 --> 53:39.455
That parade is full of refugees...

53:39.633 --> 53:42.750
Who were unwillingly
chased out of reality.

53:42.928 --> 53:45.965
You are collecting those
with stolen technology.

53:46.140 --> 53:48.472
Do you plan to take over
the world of dreams?

53:49.393 --> 53:51.634
I am protecting them.

53:51.812 --> 53:54.645
I am the guardian of dreams.

53:55.941 --> 54:00.560
My duty is to mete out justice
to terrorists like you, paprika.

54:03.991 --> 54:08.325
Don't make me get rough with you.

54:13.041 --> 54:16.329
Paprika, wake up! Paprika!

54:17.254 --> 54:19.586
Awakening a subject

54:22.342 --> 54:23.548
wake up, chiba!

54:24.887 --> 54:26.593
Chiba! Paprika!

54:49.870 --> 54:52.156
The sphinx look doesn't suit you.

54:55.167 --> 54:56.907
An intelligent researcher by day...

54:57.085 --> 55:00.669
The chairman's humble servant
by night, is that it?

55:00.839 --> 55:03.956
Shut up! I have many faces.
That makes me human!

55:04.843 --> 55:09.553
Oedipus is the perfect look for a man
completely controlled by the chairman!

55:09.723 --> 55:11.634
Shut up!

55:24.404 --> 55:27.862
That's right, keep running.

55:28.033 --> 55:29.819
There are ho boundaries to dreams.

55:29.993 --> 55:32.951
The spirit will be freed
from the constraints of the body...

55:33.121 --> 55:35.203
And gain limitless freedom.

55:35.374 --> 55:36.910
Including me!

55:38.585 --> 55:42.294
[I will also be free!

55:53.809 --> 55:56.175
The dream continues from here.

56:08.866 --> 56:10.857
No! Paprika!

56:11.034 --> 56:12.820
It's a trap!

56:23.088 --> 56:26.455
Chief! Wake her up! Hurry!

57:01.376 --> 57:03.742
What a lovely sight.

57:04.963 --> 57:09.002
Osanai! What is this? Let me go!

57:09.176 --> 57:11.417
But I finally caught you.

57:11.595 --> 57:14.507
Where is tokita?

57:15.015 --> 57:17.848
I have no interest
in such ugly things.

57:19.519 --> 57:24.513
Of course, because you're not.
You were himuro's idol after all.

57:24.691 --> 57:25.931
Shut up! Just shut up!

57:26.109 --> 57:28.691
You sold your body
for the DC mini, didn't you?

57:29.613 --> 57:30.978
Don't remind me!

57:31.156 --> 57:33.067
- You coward!
- Stop it!

57:35.869 --> 57:39.953
This is my sanctuary,
and you'll do as I say.

57:42.459 --> 57:46.998
- I'm a special person.
- Yes, hand-chosen by the chairman.

57:47.172 --> 57:49.754
Osanai, you used to be
smarter than that.

57:49.925 --> 57:53.463
You don't know its true power!

57:55.639 --> 57:59.131
The DC mini was,
in a way, complete.

57:59.309 --> 58:01.641
No, better than complete.

58:02.312 --> 58:05.054
We can now go back and forth
between dreams and reality...

58:05.232 --> 58:08.395
Even without the DC mini,
while awake.

58:08.902 --> 58:11.735
You were the one who set up Atsuko
at himuro's place.

58:13.240 --> 58:18.075
It was just a friendly warning
to a terrorist threatening dreams.

58:18.996 --> 58:22.079
You're just like an old baldy I know.

58:22.666 --> 58:27.660
We are the chosen ones assigned
to protect the sanctuary...

58:27.838 --> 58:32.832
Threatened by technology
that has lost its philosophy.

58:33.010 --> 58:34.625
You're just twisted.

58:34.803 --> 58:36.543
You should understand.

58:36.722 --> 58:39.429
Dreams are so sacred
they cannot be controlled...

58:39.599 --> 58:44.343
What would you know? You're just
a little man controlled by jealousy.

58:45.564 --> 58:49.273
You really think
you can beat tokita?

58:53.947 --> 58:58.441
I warned you,
don't make me get rough.

59:10.297 --> 59:12.504
You should call it a night.

59:12.674 --> 59:15.507
Don't worry, I'm drunk.

59:15.677 --> 59:19.465
The fact that I know I'm drunk
is proof that I'm sober.

59:19.639 --> 59:21.971
This isn't a real bar.

59:22.142 --> 59:26.602
And this isn't real alcohol,
and you're not a real bartender.

59:27.647 --> 59:29.103
Right?

59:30.192 --> 59:32.228
I'm sober.

59:33.403 --> 59:38.488
Even if odds and sods
go around in my head.

59:40.827 --> 59:43.068
Paprika will come, right?

59:50.504 --> 59:52.995
Do you not like the number 17?

59:55.509 --> 59:58.876
The conspiratorial 17.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:06.805
You're familiar with movies
as if you've made them before.

01:00:09.022 --> 01:00:13.686
I did. Shot an independent
on an 8 mm.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.691
It was child's play.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:18.353
When you were in high school?

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.693
When I was 17...

01:00:41.012 --> 01:00:43.424
It's a silly cop story.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:47.216
Two men
who used to be best friends.

01:00:47.394 --> 01:00:51.353
Are now fugitive and cop
engaged in a chase.

01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:55.732
They just keep running...

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:59.065
And flashbacks of their past
play throughout.

01:00:59.239 --> 01:01:02.072
Very experimental.

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:04.365
That guy...

01:01:05.745 --> 01:01:08.487
How could I have forgotten
about him until now?

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:15.869
He was always one step
ahead of me.

01:01:18.049 --> 01:01:20.506
He was smart and popular
with the girls.

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.006
I could never catch up with him.

01:01:27.184 --> 01:01:30.392
I was frustrated at myself
for not being frustrated with him.

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:33.182
He really was a good guy.

01:01:33.356 --> 01:01:36.769
We talked about
making movies together.

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:43.527
But I gave up.
I didn't have the confidence.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.783
I left the unfinished movie
for him to deal with.

01:01:48.663 --> 01:01:50.904
And that friend now?

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:54.162
He died.

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:59.129
He had just gotten accepted
to film school, but he was sick.

01:02:00.759 --> 01:02:03.626
He didn't tell me.

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:06.590
I betrayed him.

01:02:06.765 --> 01:02:10.132
I was his partner.
I was his counterpart.

01:02:10.310 --> 01:02:12.050
He was the other...

01:02:13.647 --> 01:02:16.229
The other me.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.408
But what about the rest of it?!

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:35.782
Wait!

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:56.478
Stop!

01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:59.310
- Why do you dress like a girl?
- Paprika!

01:02:59.484 --> 01:03:01.975
The real you is
more befitting of me.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:03.985
Paprika!

01:03:05.824 --> 01:03:08.782
Stop, please...

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:13.195
You jealous, perverted prince!

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:17.620
You have a bad habit of trying
to manipulate people with your words.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.957
And you think you can
manipulate people with power?

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:23.747
In here, yes.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.636
I love you.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:42.182
I love you as you are.

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:20.971
I will show no mercy
for those who defy me.

01:04:21.149 --> 01:04:22.434
Chairman...

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:25.646
You cannot hide anything from me.

01:04:32.452 --> 01:04:35.944
Chairman, not her. Not her!

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:39.956
Can you not control
even one sensual desire?

01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.167
Please! Please spare her!

01:04:47.342 --> 01:04:52.132
Why won't you obey me?
You are nothing without me!

01:04:54.516 --> 01:04:57.383
But I love her.

01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:08.977
Paprika!

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:13.648
Are you okay?

01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:19.162
I knew you were paprika.

01:05:21.376 --> 01:05:25.665
What are you doing? You will obey!

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.843
Disgusting.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:42.807
You fool.
Swayed by a mere woman.

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:02.201
I'm too anxious to dream!

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:05.127
Konakawa?

01:06:05.753 --> 01:06:08.540
Shima? Is that you?

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:10.128
Konakawa.

01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:14.634
- Why are you in chiba's dream?
- Why are you a monkey?

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:18.012
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later. Just go!

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:19.719
(So where?

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.258
To your dream!

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.450
Don't get in the way of my dream!

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:44.368
This is my dream. You get out!

01:06:51.299 --> 01:06:54.632
I am justice!

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:01.135
Freeze!

01:07:10.109 --> 01:07:12.896
How's that for traumatic?

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:21.697
What about the rest of it?!

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:26.577
It's coming up right now!

01:07:28.086 --> 01:07:30.577
This time, I'll end it!

01:07:35.134 --> 01:07:37.216
That hurts.

01:07:47.313 --> 01:07:49.053
It's over.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.608
Chief

01:08:40.867 --> 01:08:43.609
is this really the real world?

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.026
I think so.

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:48.697
See? It hurt a lot.

01:08:54.547 --> 01:08:57.630
But why was konakawa
in your dream?

01:08:58.343 --> 01:09:02.336
That's right, paprika was saved
by Mr. konakawa.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:06.631
The chairman and osanail

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.721
tokita! What about tokita?

01:09:24.619 --> 01:09:25.950
Osanai! What's wrong?

01:09:26.996 --> 01:09:28.236
Osanail

01:09:31.334 --> 01:09:34.497
no! No! Osanai! You can't go!

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:38.255
That body is mine!
I will not allow you to act on your own!

01:09:38.424 --> 01:09:43.168
My noble spirit needs that body!

01:09:43.346 --> 01:09:49.433
When the two become one,
I will be complete!

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.605
Something's wrong.

01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:59.859
Not just tokita, but what
just happened with osanai.

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:03.646
Don't worry.
We just need to get the mastermind.

01:10:03.825 --> 01:10:05.736
A happy ending
is right around the corner.

01:10:06.786 --> 01:10:11.951
But that mastermind
is lost in his own delusion.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.205
No problem.

01:10:14.293 --> 01:10:16.534
We have backup.

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.328
Mr. konakawa

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:24.167
the number you called for
assisting young children...

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:29.180
Is not available because of
crowded tires in the pacific ocean.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:31.807
Starting at 7:63 A.M.

01:11:03.301 --> 01:11:05.166
The battle has ended.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:12.007
Now it's showtime!

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.410
Today's weather is dreamy...

01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:44.122
And will clear up after a sunny,
sunny, sunny, sunny, sunny day.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.588
The dream I had yesterday
and today.

01:11:47.762 --> 01:11:50.378
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

01:11:51.182 --> 01:11:55.642
The dreams will grow and grow.
Let's grow the tree that blooms money.

01:11:56.229 --> 01:11:59.266
It's most valuable
while it's still a bud.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:02.398
That's right, so we shall preserve
the memory forever.

01:12:02.902 --> 01:12:06.394
If there is no flower,
there will be no fruit

01:12:06.572 --> 01:12:09.154
if there's nothing,
then I won't do anything.

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:15.658
If you're unhappy,
please put a vote in this eyeball.

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.373
Who would give up this throne?

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:23.036
I am the emperor,
chosen by the lord himself!

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.170
- I didn't choose you!
- I didn't choose youl!

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:28.583
God and Buddha
will change religions.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:32.003
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:35.719
The happy and mundane world
will vent their anger.

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:39.136
Am I still dreaming?

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:42.931
Yes, the whole world is.

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:49.270
You forgot this.

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:52.524
Thank you.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:54.943
Now, let's go. “Where?

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:58.491
To clean up this mess.

01:13:07.383 --> 01:13:09.840
Dreams and reality are merging?

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:12.502
Is this because of the DC mini too?

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:23.979
Chief! Hold on!

01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:41.246
Paprika”

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:44.329
no time for questions. Hurry up!

01:13:48.591 --> 01:13:50.331
Why are you here?

01:13:50.509 --> 01:13:52.591
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:55.757
Is this reality?

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.598
Hurry! We have to get
the mastermind!

01:14:00.227 --> 01:14:01.967
[T's as if we're in a dream.

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:08.732
Hurry!

01:14:08.903 --> 01:14:10.609
Don't get ahead
of yourself, paprika!

01:14:14.075 --> 01:14:16.737
Don't think you're always right.

01:14:47.733 --> 01:14:48.939
Tokita.

01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:52.485
- Let's go, Atsuko.
- I have to help tokita.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:55.021
Leave that irresponsible fatso.

01:14:56.617 --> 01:15:01.031
Why don't you listen?
You're a part of me!

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:05.411
Have you ever thought
that maybe you are a part of me?

01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:06.869
Do as I say!

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:14.877
You're just like an old baldy I know.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:24.558
Let's go. We need to stop
that old baldy and his excursions.

01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:25.889
- Now!
- No!

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:29.647
I can't just leave tokita because I...

01:15:30.943 --> 01:15:33.025
Because what?

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:40.358
Chiba!

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:44.536
She's become true to herself,
hasn't she?

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:48.536
An overweight spirit needs no diet!

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:51.877
Go forward, superhero,
to anywhere you please!

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.539
Tokita, wake up! It's me!

01:15:56.135 --> 01:15:58.251
The one I've been waiting for
since historic times!

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:00.920
Your flute's melody
is a sound for sore neurons!

01:16:01.098 --> 01:16:02.554
Yes, try to remember.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:06.183
Atsuko, the one you like!
It's me, at-chan!

01:16:09.690 --> 01:16:12.602
A fragrant fat is a first-class lunch!

01:16:16.363 --> 01:16:18.274
It needs a little more spice.

01:16:19.617 --> 01:16:21.153
Maybe a little paprika?

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:44.763
What is this?

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.765
A big hole.

01:16:46.936 --> 01:16:48.301
I can see that!

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:53.390
It's connected.
“To the other world.

01:16:53.567 --> 01:16:55.728
The other... you mean. 7?

01:16:58.364 --> 01:17:00.946
What should we do?

01:17:02.409 --> 01:17:05.572
Run? You think so too?

01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:16.087
Well-rounded achievement
is missing a spice.

01:17:16.257 --> 01:17:18.043
Paprika found!

01:17:32.565 --> 01:17:33.975
Hey!

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:37.734
Paprika! Shima!
Are you two okay?

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:41.650
Mr. konakawal - konakawa

01:17:53.752 --> 01:17:54.992
Chiba?

01:18:04.722 --> 01:18:07.589
I'm in a bind.

01:18:08.893 --> 01:18:10.099
I can see that.

01:18:14.064 --> 01:18:16.430
It's not that!

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:35.790
Sorry.

01:18:36.503 --> 01:18:39.245
You're such a slob.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.209
I know.

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:45.922
You're fat, slow and sloppy.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:52.217
It's not the outside that counts,
but there's a limit to that too.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.055
Yeah.

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:59.145
To think, a food disposal like you
is the genius of the century.

01:19:01.028 --> 01:19:02.939
I swallow everything.

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:08.817
I know. You're so much fun.

01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:16.456
Atsuko is dreaming.

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:35.681
What is that? Our chairman!

01:19:35.854 --> 01:19:38.345
I feel great!

01:19:38.524 --> 01:19:41.687
I am reborn!

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:51.033
Look! I am standing!
With my own legs!

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:52.443
I am perfect!

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:57.448
I can control the dreams,
and even death!

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:01.877
Now, to make
the cosmos complete...

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:06.381
I shall heal all deficiencies!

01:20:08.887 --> 01:20:12.425
Way to go, lord of darkness!

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:17.890
Light and dark. Reality and dreams.
Life and death. Man and.?

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:20.349
Woman? “Woman?

01:20:20.524 --> 01:20:23.357
Then you add the missing spice.

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:25.392
- Paprika??
- Paprika?

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.561
Bingo.

01:20:33.704 --> 01:20:35.410
Paprika!

01:20:35.873 --> 01:20:40.833
The new cosmos begins with me!

01:21:27.925 --> 01:21:31.088
Who is eating up my dream?

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:39.466
Is that paprika?

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:42.682
Well, it's a qirl.

01:21:50.489 --> 01:21:52.229
Why won't you obey?

01:22:57.556 --> 01:23:01.140
Have we awoken from the dream?

01:23:22.206 --> 01:23:24.242
I just had the best dream.

01:23:25.792 --> 01:23:30.252
I had a good dream too.
The first in a long time.

01:23:42.059 --> 01:23:46.393
- I guess I've been dumped.
- You mean you were serious?

01:23:46.563 --> 01:23:49.430
But paprika is a woman
in your dreams.

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:54.026
That's true. I'll see her
in my dreams again some day.

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:59.190
How are your dreams going?

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:01.324
I almost forgot about it.

01:24:02.412 --> 01:24:04.198
Did you find out
what was causing it?

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:07.202
The cause

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:13.207
you didn't do anything wrong.

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:19.134
You just lived out our movie
in real life.

01:24:19.304 --> 01:24:22.467
That's why you became a cop.

01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:27.180
It's truth that came from fiction.
Always remember that.

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:31.559
Yeah, all the truths and the fiction.

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.070
Welcome.

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.583
I have a message for you
from miss paprika.

01:24:56.216 --> 01:25:01.131
I heard you caught the perpetrator in
that homicide case. Congratulations.

01:25:01.305 --> 01:25:04.172
I also have an announcement:

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:09.101
Atsuko's last name
will change to tokita.

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:12.388
Ps

01:25:12.566 --> 01:25:16.980
The movie dreaming kids
was very good. I recommend it.

01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:31.990
Dreaming kids

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:42.050
One adult, please.
